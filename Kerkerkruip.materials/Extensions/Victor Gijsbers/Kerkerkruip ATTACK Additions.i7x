Kerkerkruip ATTACK Additions by Victor Gijsbers begins here.

Use authorial modesty.

Section - No concentrating outside of combat

Check concentrating (this is the do not concentrate outside of combat rule):
	if combat status is peace:
		say "[We] [can] only concentrate in a combat situation." instead.

Section - No readying what you don't have

First check readying (this is the do not ready weapons on the ground rule):

Section - Losing concentration only for worldsharers

To relax is a verb.

This is the new everyone loses concentration when combat status is peace rule:
	if combat status is peace:
		if concentration of the player is not 0:
			now concentration of the player is 0;
			say "[We] [relax] [our] concentration.";
		now world test subject is the player;
		repeat with guy running through alive worldsharer people:
			now concentration of guy is 0.
			
new everyone loses concentration when combat status is peace rule is listed instead of the everyone loses concentration when combat status is peace rule in the combat round rules.

Section - Replacing concentration

A person can be normal-concentrating or abnormal-concentrating. A person is usually normal-concentrating.

An add specific damage rule (this is the new concentration damage modifier rule):
	if damage-by-hitting is true:
		if global attacker is normal-concentrating:
			if the concentration of the global attacker is greater than 1:
				let the first dummy be 0;
				if the concentration of the global attacker is 2, now the first dummy is 2;
				if the concentration of the global attacker is 3, now the first dummy is 4;
				add first dummy points of physical damage with reason "concentration".

The concentration damage modifier rule is not listed in any rulebook.


Section - Attacking when the combat status is peace (Nomos, slaves)

[Nomos. Attack slaves.]

This is the alternative do not kill yourself rule:
	if the noun is the player and Nomos bonus is false:
		take no time;
		say "[We] [are] not that desperate!" instead.
		
The alternative do not kill yourself rule is listed instead of the do not kill yourself rule in the check attacking rulebook.

Attacking-from-peace is a truth state that varies. Attacking-from-peace is false.

This is the alternative do not attack friendly people rule:
	if the faction of the player does not hate the faction of the noun:
		if the faction of the noun is player-enslaved:
			now the noun is betrayed;
			if combat status is peace:
				now attacking-from-peace is true;
			now faction of the noun is hostile;
		otherwise:
			if the Nomos bonus is true:
				unless the noun is the player:
					if combat status is peace:
						now attacking-from-peace is true;
					now faction of the noun is hostile;
			otherwise:
				take no time;
				say "[The noun] [are] [our] friend, not [our] enemy!" instead.
				
The alternative do not attack friendly people rule is listed instead of the do not attack friendly people rule in the check attacking rulebook.

The do not attack neutral people rule is not listed in any rulebook.

First check attacking:
	now attacking-from-peace is false. [If it didn't get reset for some reason.]

Last report attacking:
	if attacking-from-peace is true:
		now attacking-from-peace is false;
		now combat state of the noun is at-React;
		run the AI rules for the noun;
		now the combat status is concluding;
		follow the run delayed actions rule;
		follow the conclude the combat round rule.



Section - New rolling mechanism

[This roll creates a number between 1 and 10, but biased towards the middle values. This makes combat somewhat less random, which benefits the player and makes penalties and bonuses more important. However, we also allow a 10 to turn into a 20, so that everyone has a chance to hit everyone.

Instead of the standard 1d10 of ATTACK, we roll 1d7 + 1d4 - 1.]

The roller is a person that varies. [The guy who is rolling the dice. Used in the natural twenty rules.]
The special set attack strength rules are a rulebook. [Used for periapt of prophecy]

An attack modifier rule (this is the alternative attack roll rule):
	now roller is the global attacker;
	now the attack strength is 0;
	follow the special set attack strength rules;
	if attack strength is 0: [nothing intervened]
		now the attack strength is a roll of the dice;
	say "[italic type]Rolling ", the attack strength, "[run paragraph on]".
	
The alternative attack roll rule is listed instead of the standard attack roll rule in the attack modifier rules.

The natural twenty chance is a number that varies.
The natural twenty rules are a rulebook.

To decide which number is a roll of the dice:
	let n be a random number between 1 and 7;
	let m be a random number between 0 and 3;
	let x be n + m;
	now natural twenty chance is 0;
	follow the natural twenty rules;
	if a random chance of natural twenty chance in 100 succeeds:
		now x is 20;
	decide on x.

[1: 1/28
2: 2/28
3: 3/28
4-7: 4/28
8: 3/28
9: 2/28
10: 1/28]

Section - Adjust AI

[Since there's always a small chance of rolling 20, attacking is never useless.]

An AI action selection rule for an at-Act person (called P) (this is the new standard attack select rule):
	choose row with an Option of the action of the main actor attacking the chosen target in the Table of AI Action Options;
	if the normalised chance-to-win is 0:
		now the Action Weight entry is -20;
	decrease the Action Weight entry by 5;
	increase the Action Weight entry by the normalised chance-to-win;

The new standard attack select rule is listed instead of the standard attack select rule in the AI action selection rules.


Section - Weapon interactions during aftereffects

To decide whether (striker - a thing) struck (stricken - a thing):
	decide on whether or not stricken is whatever striker struck;
		
To decide what object is whatever (item - a thing) struck:
	if the attack hit:
		if item is the global attacker weapon, decide on the global defender;
		if item is the global defender, decide on the global attacker weapon;
		decide on nothing;
	if item is the global attacker weapon:
		if the global defender is at parry, decide on the global defender weapon;
		if the global defender is at-block, decide on a random shield worn by the global defender;
		decide on nothing;
	[The next line makes this phrase asymmetrical -
	 the global attacker weapon can hit weapons and shields if it is ranged, but they can't hit it]
	if the global attacker weapon is ranged and the global attacker weapon is not a natural weapon, decide on nothing;
	if item is the global defender weapon and the global defender is at parry, decide on the global attacker weapon;
	if item is a shield worn by the global defender and the global defender is at-block, decide on the global attacker weapon;
	decide on nothing.

Section - Losing concentration

The alternative lose concentration when hit rule is listed instead of the lose concentration when hit rule in the aftereffects rules.

The remain concentrated chance is a number that varies.
The remain concentrated rules are a rulebook.

To remain is a verb.

An aftereffects rule (this is the alternative lose concentration when hit rule):
	if the total damage is greater than 0 and the global defender is alive and the concentration of the global defender is not 0:
		now the remain concentrated chance is 0;
		follow the remain concentrated rules;
		unless a random chance of remain concentrated chance in 100 succeeds:
			let the global defender lose concentration;
		otherwise:
			say "[The global defender] [bold type][remain] concentrated[roman type].";.

A remain concentrated rule (this is the damage penalty for remaining concentrated rule):
	decrease remain concentrated chance by total damage.

Section - Killing

Last after reporting an actor hitting (this is the killing after attack rule):
	if the global defender is dead:
		have an event of the global attacker killing the global defender.

Section - Some ATTACK prose rules	
	
[Last final blow report rule (this is the new end reporting blow with paragraph break rule):
	if global defender is alive, say "[paragraph break]".]

The basic fatal player flavour rule is not listed in any rulebook.
The basic fatal flavour rule is not listed in any rulebook.
The basic flavour rule is not listed in any rulebook.
The the improper print dead property rule is not listed in any rulebook.
The proper print dead property rule is not listed in any rulebook.


Section - Using question prompts

[A combat round rule when the combat status is peace (this is the not quite business as usual rule):
	now the main actor is the player;
	unless closed question mode is true:
		now the command prompt is the peaceful prompt;
	carry out the taking a player action activity;

The not quite business as usual rule is listed instead of the business as usual rule in the combat round rules.]

Before taking a player action:
	if closed question mode is true and menu question mode is true:
		now the command prompt is the saved question prompt;
		if repeat-question is true:
			ask a closed question, in menu mode.

Section - Other stuff

An AI target selection rule (this is the randomise the target result more rule):
	increase the Weight by a random number between 0 and 3;

Understand "creature" as a person.

Check switching the numbers off:
	say "The numerical representation of combat cannot be switched off in this game." instead.



[This could be fun, but it needs to be an option that can be set to: none, short, medium, long.]
[The non-standard attack roll rule is listed instead of the standard attack roll rule in the basic attack roll rules.

This is the non-standard attack roll rule:
	if the numbers boolean is true, say "[italic type]Rolling [run paragraph on]";
	wait 500 milliseconds before continuing, strictly;
	change the to-hit roll to a random number between 1 and 10;
	if the numbers boolean is true, say the to-hit roll, "[run paragraph on]";
	wait 500 milliseconds before continuing, strictly;.
]

Section - Because sometimes one can attack outside combat

[As I write this, this is only possible when the player attacks himself when commanded by Nomos.]
First carry out attacking the player when the combat status is peace (this is the attack self when not in combat rule):
	try the actor hitting the noun instead;



Chapter - Faculties

[Up to version 5, Kerkerkruip used Perception, Dexterity and Willpower. From version 6 on, we will use Body, Mind and Spirit instead. These will also be much more interesting.]

A person has a number called body score. The body score of a person is usually 5.
A person has a number called mind score. The mind score of a person is usually 5.
A person has a number called spirit score. The spirit score of a person is usually 5.

A faculty is a kind of object. body, mind and spirit are faculties.

Section - Faculty bonuses

The body bonus rules are a rulebook.
The mind bonus rules are a rulebook.
The spirit bonus rules are a rulebook.
The faculty bonus rules are a rulebook.

To process (RL - a rule): (- FollowRulebook({RL}, 0, true); -).

Faculty bonus score is a number that varies.

To decide which number is the body bonus of (guy - a person):
	now test subject is guy;
	now faculty bonus score is 0;
	process the body bonus rules;
	say "[run paragraph on]";	
	process the faculty bonus rules;
	say "[run paragraph on]";
	decide on faculty bonus score.
	
To decide which number is the final body of (guy - a person):
	let n be body score of the guy plus body bonus of the guy;
	say "[run paragraph on]";	
	decide on n.

To decide which number is the mind bonus of (guy - a person):
	now test subject is guy;
	now faculty bonus score is 0;
	process the mind bonus rules;
	say "[run paragraph on]";
	process the faculty bonus rules;
	say "[run paragraph on]";	
	decide on faculty bonus score.
	
To decide which number is the final mind of (guy - a person):
	let n be mind score of the guy plus mind bonus of the guy;
	say "[run paragraph on]";	
	decide on n.
	
To decide which number is the spirit bonus of (guy - a person):
	now test subject is guy;
	now faculty bonus score is 0;
	process the spirit bonus rules;
	say "[run paragraph on]";	
	process the faculty bonus rules;
	say "[run paragraph on]";
	decide on faculty bonus score.
	
To decide which number is the final spirit of (guy - a person):
	let n be spirit score of the guy plus spirit bonus of the guy;
	say "[run paragraph on]";	
	decide on n.

Section - Testing faculties

The tested faculty is a faculty that varies.

To test the body of (guy - a person) against (n - a number) described as (target description - some text):
	now tested faculty is body;
	test the faculty of guy against n described as the target description.

To test the mind of (guy - a person) against (n - a number) described as (target description - some text):
	now tested faculty is mind;
	test the faculty of guy against n described as the target description.

To test the spirit of (guy - a person) against (n - a number) described as (target description - some text):
	now tested faculty is spirit;
	test the faculty of guy against n described as the target description.

To test the faculty of (guy - a person) against (n - a number) described as (target description - some text):
	now test subject is guy;
	now roller is the guy;
	now test score is a roll of the dice;
	say "[The guy] [roll] ", test score, " + [run paragraph on]";
	if tested faculty is body:
		let k be final body of the guy;
		say "[k] (body)[run paragraph on]";
		increase test score by k;
	if tested faculty is mind:
		let k be final mind of guy;
		say "[k] (mind)[run paragraph on]";
		increase test score by k;
	if tested faculty is spirit:
		let k be final spirit of guy;
		say "[k] (spirit)[run paragraph on]";
		increase test score by k;		
	say " = [test score] against a target number of ", n, "[unless the target description is empty] ([the target description])[end unless][run paragraph on]";
	if test score is less than n:
		say ", failing the [tested faculty] check.[run paragraph on]";
		now test result is false;
	otherwise:
		say ", succeeding at the [tested faculty] check.[run paragraph on]";
		now test result is true.

To test the body of (guy - a person) against (n - a number):
	now tested faculty is body;

	test the faculty of guy against n described as "".

To test the faculty of (guy - a person) against (n - a number):
	test the faculty of guy against n described as "":

Section - Faculty increase

Unallocated faculty is a number that varies. Unallocated faculty is 0.

[The grant routine is called by power transferral in Kerkerkruip Systems.]

To grant a faculty increase of (n - a number):
	increase unallocated faculty by n;
	say "[We] [can] now increase one of [our] faculties by [bold type][unallocated faculty] point[if unallocated faculty is not 1]s[end if][roman type]. (Type 'body', 'mind', or 'spirit', depending on [our] choice.) [run paragraph on]".
	
Last status skill rule (this is the unallocated faculty rule):
	if unallocated faculty is greater than 0:
		say "[italic type][We] [can] increase one of [our] faculties by [bold type][unallocated faculty] point[if unallocated faculty is not 1]s[end if][italic type]. (Type 'body', 'mind', or 'spirit', depending on [our] choice. This action takes no time.)[roman type][line break][run paragraph on]".

Increasing body is an action out of world. Understand "body" as increasing body.
Increasing mind is an action out of world. Understand "mind" as increasing mind.
Increasing spirit is an action out of world. Understand "spirit" as increasing spirit.

Check increasing body:
	if unallocated faculty is less than 1:
		say "[We] [do not have] any points left!" instead.

Check increasing mind:
	if unallocated faculty is less than 1:
		say "[We] [do not have] any points left!" instead.

Check increasing spirit:
	if unallocated faculty is less than 1:
		say "[We] [do not have] any points left!" instead.

[Okay, this is where I draw the line. My obsession with adaptive text may be extreme, but this would be ridiculous to implement as adaptive - Mike]

Carry out increasing body:
	increase body score of the player by unallocated faculty;
	say "[Our] basic body increases to [body score of the player]; [our] effective body is now [run paragraph on][final body of the player].[line break][paragraph break]";
	now unallocated faculty is 0.

Carry out increasing mind:
	increase mind score of the player by unallocated faculty;
	say "[Our] basic mind increases to [mind score of the player][run paragraph on][if mind score of player is not final mind of player]; [our] effective mind is now [run paragraph on][final mind of the player][end if].[line break][paragraph break]";
	now unallocated faculty is 0.
	
Carry out increasing spirit:
	increase spirit score of the player by unallocated faculty;
	say "[Our] basic spirit increases to [spirit score of the player]; [our] effective spirit is now [run paragraph on][final spirit of the player].[line break][paragraph break]";
	now unallocated faculty is 0.

Section - Direct benefits of faculties

An attack modifier rule (this is the body defence bonus rule):
	let n be the final body of the global defender;
	if a random chance of n in 50 succeeds:
		say " - 3 (random body bonus)[run paragraph on]";
		decrease the attack strength by 3.
	
A remain concentrated rule (this is the mind bonus for remaining concentrated rule):
	increase remain concentrated chance by 2 times final mind of the global defender.

Initiative update rule (this is the increase initiative based on spirit rule):
	repeat with X running through all alive persons enclosed by the location:
		let n be the final spirit of X;
		if a random chance of n in 40 succeeds:
			increase the initiative of X by a random number between 1 and 3.

[Critical hit chance is determined by the lowest of [our] three attributes.]
A natural twenty rule (this is the faculties natural twenty rule):
	let n be final body of the roller;
	let o be final mind of the roller;
	let p be final spirit of the roller;
	if o is less than n:
		now n is o;
	if p is less than n:
		now n is p;
	increase natural twenty chance by n.







Section - Inherent damage modifier 

A person has a number called the inherent damage modifier. The inherent damage modifier of a person is usually 0.

[ TODO: Should this be a standard part of ATTACK? ]
An add specific damage rule (this is the inherent damage modifier rule):
	if damage-by-hitting is true:
		if the inherent damage modifier of the global attacker is not 0:
			add (inherent damage modifier of the global attacker) points of physical damage with reason "inherent bonus".


Section - Weapon descriptions

Last report examining a weapon (this is the extra weapon info rule):
	say "[italic type]Combat statistics: 1d[damage die of the noun] + [weapon damage bonus of the noun] damage; [if weapon attack bonus of the noun is less than 0]-[otherwise]+[end if][absolute value of weapon attack bonus of the noun to the nearest whole number] attack modifier[if the noun is ranged]; ranged[end if][parry and dodge info of the noun][if the noun is silver]; good against undead and demons[end if][special weapon info of the noun][roman type].[run paragraph on][line break][paragraph break]"
			
To say parry and dodge info of (item - a weapon):
	say "; the wielder gets a [parry-with bonus of item] bonus when parrying with [regarding the item][them]; others get a [parry-against bonus of item] bonus when parrying and a [dodge bonus of item] bonus when dodging against [them][run paragraph on]".

A weapon has some text called the special weapon info. The special weapon info of a weapon is usually "".


Section - Cleaning the Table of Delayed Actions

To clean the table of delayed actions for (guy - a person):
	repeat through the table of delayed actions:
		let this action be the action to take entry;
		if the actor part of this action is the guy or the noun part of this action is the guy:
			blank out the whole row.

A killing rule (this is the reset killed-guy rule):
	follow the sudden combat reset rules for killed-guy.


Section - Blocking

[In Kerkerkruip, blocking is only available if you are wearing a shield!]

Check blocking (this is the cannot block when not wearing a shield rule):
	if the player is not wearing a shield:
		take no time;
		say "[We] [cannot block] when [we]['re not] wearing a shield." instead.

An AI action selection rule for an at-React person (called P) (this is the AI block without shields rule):
	choose row with an Option of the action of P blocking in the Table of AI Action Options;
	if P does not wear a shield:
		decrease Action Weight entry by 1000.

An attack modifier rule (this is the block defence bonus rule):
	if the global defender is at-block:
		if the global defender encloses a worn shield:
			let item be a random shield worn by the global defender;
			let n be block bonus of item;
			decrease the attack strength by n;
			if the numbers boolean is true:
				if n is greater than 0:
					say " - ", n, " (block bonus)[run paragraph on]";
				if n is less than 0:
					now n is (0 - n);
					say " + ", n, " (block penalty)[run paragraph on]";
