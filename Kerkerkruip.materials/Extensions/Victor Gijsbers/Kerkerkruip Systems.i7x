Kerkerkruip Systems by Victor Gijsbers begins here.

Use authorial modesty.

Volume - Systems

Test score is a number that varies.
Test result is a truth state that varies.
The test subject is a person that varies.
The test room is a room that varies.
The test object is an object that varies.



Part - Keeping track of where things are

Section - Worldsharable

Definition: a thing is worldsharable if it is not off-stage.

Definition: a backdrop is worldsharable: no.

Definition: a person is worldsharable if it is not off-stage and it is alive.

Section - Denizen

Definition: a thing is denizen if it is worldsharable and the location of it is placed.

Section - World sharing

To decide whether (guy - a thing) and (other guy - a thing) share a world:
	if guy is not worldsharable or other guy is not worldsharable:
		decide no;
	if the location of guy is the location of other guy:
		decide yes;
	if guy is denizen and other guy is denizen:
		decide yes;
	if guy is a backdrop or other guy is a backdrop:
		[avoid testing the location of a backdrop]
		[this will not work correctly if the backdrop is present somewhere besides the main dungeon]
		decide no;
	if location of guy is location of other guy:
		decide yes;
	let way be best route from (location of guy) to (location of other guy);
	if way is a direction:
		decide yes;
	repeat with wherever running through regions:
		if location of guy is in wherever:
			if location of other guy is in wherever:
				decide yes;
	decide no.

Section - Worldsharer

[ALWAYS set the world test subject before asking about worldsharers.]

World test subject is a thing that varies. World test subject is yourself.

Definition: a thing is worldsharer if it and world test subject share a world.

Part - Properties of rooms

[Standard set of properties:
X is connectable.
X is not connection-inviting.
X is placeable.
X is habitable.
X is treasurable.
X is vp-agnostic.
X is not consecrated.
X is civilised/religious/barren/deathly/elemental/magical/alchemical]


Section - Placement properties

A room can be connectable. A room is usually connectable. [Additional connections can be made in the last stage of making the map, and digging is allowed.]

A room can be connection-inviting. A room is usually not connection-inviting. [If connection-inviting (and connectable), all possible connections to this room will be made.]

A room can be placeable. A room is usually placeable. [Not placeable rooms are not considered during the normal dungeon creation.]

A room can be secretly placeable. A room is usually not secretly placeable. [A room can be both placeable and secretly placeable. If so, it has a chance to be placed in the main dungeon and another outside the connected dungeon.]

A room can be habitable. A room is usually habitable. [Monsters can be placed in it.]

A room can be treasurable. A room is usually treasurable. [Treasures can be placed in it.]

A room can be extra-accepting. A room is usually extra-accepting. [Extras can be placed in it.]

A room can be nogo. A room is usually not nogo. [Nogo rooms are not listed in exits and remember commands.]

To mark (place - a room) as normally placed:
	now place is placed;
	now place is not secretly placeable;

To mark (place - a room) as secretly placed:
	now place is placed;
	now place is secretly placeable;
	now place is not teleportable;

Section - Derived Properties of Rooms

Definition: A room is secretly placed if it is placed and it is secretly placeable.

Definition: A room is normally placed if it is placed and it is placeable.

Definition: A room is denizen if it is placed and it is not nogo.

Definition: A room (called place) is memorable:
	if the place is a visited tunnel, no;
	if the place is nogo, no;
	if the place is not placed, no;
	if the place is visited, yes;
	if the place is secretly placed, no;
	yes.

Section - Vertical placement

[This section defines properties of rooms that affect how deep in the dungeon they are placed. It also contains the necessary rules for doing this.]

[vp-agnostic: standard
vp-underground: only underground
vp-likely-underground: probably underground
vp-above-ground: only above ground (z =>0)
vp-high: only above ground level (z>0)
vp-likely-high: more likely above ground]

Vertical placement is a kind of value. The vertical placements are vp-agnostic, vp-underground, vp-likely-underground, vp-above-ground, vp-high, and vp-likely-high.

A room has a vertical placement. The vertical placement of a room is usually vp-agnostic.

[A room can be underground or not underground. A room is usually not underground. [Underground rooms can only be placed underground, and are more likely than other rooms to be placed so.]]

A placement possible rule (this is the vertical placement possible rule):
	if considered room is vp-underground:
		if the considered-z is not less than 0:
			rule fails;
	if considered room is vp-above-ground:
		if the considered-z is less than 0:
			rule fails;
	if considered room is vp-high:
		if the considered-z is not greater than 0:
			rule fails.

A placement scoring rule (this is the vertical placement scoring rule):
	if considered room is vp-underground or considered room is vp-likely-underground:
		if the considered-z is less than 0:
			increase current room score by 0 - considered-z;
	if considered room is vp-high or considered room is vp-likely-high:
		if the considered-z is greater than 0:
			increase current room score by considered-z.
			
Section - Mood

[Mood is used during generation of the dungeon. Rooms with the same mood are more often placed together, and treasures are often placed in a room with fits their mood.]

Mood is a kind of value. The moods are civilised, religious, barren, deathly, elemental, magical, alchemical and non-mood.
A room has a mood. The mood of a room is usually barren.

A placement scoring rule (this is the link rooms with the same mood rule):
	if the mood of considered room is the mood of original room:
		[say "([considered room] has same mood as [original room])";]
		increase current room score by 2.

Section - Consecration

[Temples should be consecrated. Some powers -- such as extra praying abilities -- will only work in non-consecrated rooms.]

A room can be consecrated. A room is usually not consecrated.



Section - Collapse

First carry out going (this is the collapse rule):
	if the room noun of location is a room:
		if the room noun of location collapses location:
			let n be greatest power of the player;
			if a random chance of n in 3 succeeds:
				let X be room noun of location;
				change the noun exit of location to nothing;
				let reverse be the opposite of noun;
				change the reverse exit of X to nothing;
				say "With a huge crash, the [if noun is up or noun is down]staircase[otherwise]corridor[end if] [bold type]collapses[roman type] behind you!";
				now the retreat location is X;
				now X does not collapse location;
				now location does not collapse X;
				wait for any key;
			otherwise:
				say "That passage felt a bit unstable -- you feel that it [bold type]might collapse[roman type] in the future.".

Section - Tunnels

Tunnel is a kind of room. "A fairly nondescript tunnel." A tunnel is usually not placeable. A tunnel is usually not habitable. There is 35 tunnels.

[Note: we cannot use Dynamic Objects to create new tunnels without disabling fast route finding. (Fast route finding uses a table of rooms, and fails messily when we add new rooms to the game.) So I'm just starting out with 25 tunnels. We don't want the player to dig hundreds of tunnels anyway.]


Section - Digging and extra rooms

Digging is an action applying to one object.
Understand "dig [direction]" as digging.

Check digging (this is the dig in a direct rule):
	if noun is not a cardinal direction:
		say "You can only dig north, south, west, east, up, or down." instead.

A thing can be a digging tool. A thing is usually not a digging tool.

Check digging (this is the can only dig when carrying a digging tool rule):
	unless (the player has a digging tool or tunneling claws is adapted):
		take no time;
		say "You need a suitable tool to dig." instead.

Check digging (this is the only dig in connectable rooms rule):
	unless location is connectable:
		say "A magical force prevents you from digging." instead.

Check digging (this is the only dig in placed rooms rule):
	unless location is placed:
		say "A magical force prevents you from digging." instead.

Check an at-React pc digging (this is the cannot dig as reaction rule):
	take no time;
	say "You cannot dig as a reaction." instead.

Carry out digging:
	let x be the x noun of location;
	let y be the y noun of location;
	let z be the z noun of location;
	if the space at x by y by z is free:
		if there is at least one not placed tunnel:
			let item be a random not placed tunnel;
			place item from location at x by y by z;
			say "You [if tunneling claws is adapted]quickly dig[otherwise]magically create[end if] a tunnel [noun].";
			do the dig move;
		otherwise:
			say "The laws of this place prevent further digging.";
	otherwise:
		let item be the room at x by y by z;
		if item is the room noun from the location: 
			say "There already is a passage there.";
			take no time;
		otherwise:
			if item is connectable:
				change the noun exit of the location to item; 
    				let reverse be the opposite of noun; 
    				change the reverse exit of item to the location;
				say "You [if tunneling claws is adapted]quickly dig[otherwise]magically create[end if] a tunnel [noun].";
				do the dig move;
			otherwise:
				say "A magical force prevents you from digging.".

To do the dig move:
	if the player can move:
		if the combat status is not peace:
			now the player is runner;
			extract the player from combat, giving enemies a chance to hit;
			now the player is not runner;
		if the player is mobile:
			let place be the room noun of location;
			now retreat location is location;
			move the player to place;
			now the take no time boolean is false.


Last carry out looking when the location is a tunnel (this is the hint about other rooms rule):
	let K be a list of directions;
	let m be 0;
	repeat with way running through cardinal directions:
[		say "testing [way] ";]
		let x be the x way of location;
		let y be the y way of location;
		let z be the z way of location;
		if not the space at x by y by z is free:
			let place be room at x by y by z;
[			say "[place] is [way] of [location] ";]
			unless place is the room way from location:
				unless place is a tunnel:
					increase m by 1;
					add way to K;
	if m is greater than 0:
		say "There seems to be somewhat different stone [K].".




Section - Collapsing passages

Collapsing is an action applying to one object.
Understand "collapse [direction]" as collapsing.

Check collapsing (this is the collapse in a direct rule):
	if noun is not a cardinal direction:
		say "You can only collapse a passage to the north, south, west, east, up, or down." instead.

A thing can be a collapsing tool. A thing is usually not a collapsing tool.

Check collapsing (this is the can only collapse when carrying a collapsing tool rule):
	unless the player has a collapsing tool:
		say "You need a suitable tool to collapse passages." instead.

Check collapsing:
	let place be the room noun from location;
	unless place is a room:
		take no time;
		say "There is no passage there to collapse." instead;
	otherwise:
		if the location is not connectable or place is not connectable:
			take no time;
			say "A magical force prevents you from collapsing that passage." instead.

Carry out collapsing:
	let place be room noun of location;
	change the noun exit of location to nothing;
	let reverse be the opposite of noun;
	change the reverse exit of place to nothing;
	say "With a huge crash, the [if noun is up or noun is down]staircase[otherwise]corridor[end if] collapses!".


Section - Support for mapping

To decide whether the map can be shown:
	if glulx graphics is supported and glulx graphic-window mouse input is supported and glulx PNG transparency is supported:
		decide yes;
	decide no.

[Kerkerkruip's REMEMBER command uses a room's visited status to list rooms. However, we might have a need for showing rooms on the map that haven't been visited yet.]

A room can be map-revealed. A room is usually not map-revealed.

[We may need to show enemies without actually mapping the rooms they are in. We still need to reserve space on the map for necessary rooms, however, and can do so by designating rooms to be "enemy-drawn".]

A room can be enemy-revealed. A room is usually not enemy-revealed.

[It might make sense for some rooms to be drawn as if they were tunnels; these would generally be linear rooms, such as a bridge.]

A room can be tunnel-drawn. A room is usually not tunnel-drawn. A tunnel is usually tunnel-drawn.

Definition: a room (called the place) is map-ready if the place is placed and (the place is visited or the place is map-revealed or the place is enemy-revealed).

Extent-minimum-x is a number variable.
Extent-maximum-x is a number variable.
Extent-minimum-y is a number variable.
Extent-maximum-y is a number variable.
Extent-minimum-z is a number variable.
Extent-maximum-z is a number variable.

To calculate the extent of the dungeon:
	now extent-minimum-x is 100;
	now extent-maximum-x is -100;
	now extent-minimum-y is 100;
	now extent-maximum-y is -100;
	now extent-minimum-z is 100;
	now extent-maximum-z is -100;
	repeat with place running through map-ready rooms:
		let x be x-coordinate of place;
		let y be y-coordinate of place;
		let z be z-coordinate of place;
		if x is greater than extent-maximum-x:
			now extent-maximum-x is x;
		if x is less than extent-minimum-x:
			now extent-minimum-x is x;
		if y is greater than extent-maximum-y:
			now extent-maximum-y is y;
		if y is less than extent-minimum-y:
			now extent-minimum-y is y;
		if z is greater than extent-maximum-z:
			now extent-maximum-z is z;
		if z is less than extent-minimum-z:
			now extent-minimum-z is z.	


Chapter - Arenas

Section - Arena and Holding Cell Kinds

An arena is a kind of room. An arena has a room called the challenge site. An arena can be conquered.

An arena can be faction-imposing. An arena is usually not faction-imposing.
An arena can be challenged-group-inviting. An arena is usually not challenged-group-inviting.

An arena is usually not connectable.

An arena is usually not placeable.
An arena is usually not habitable.
An arena is usually not treasurable.
An arena is usually not teleportable.
An arena is usually not extra-accepting.
An arena is usually vp-agnostic.
An arena is usually magical.

A holding cell is a kind of room. The description of a holding cell is usually "BUG: the player should never end up here." 

A holding cell is usually not connectable.
A holding cell is usually not connection-inviting.
A holding cell is usually not placeable.
A holding cell is usually not habitable.
A holding cell is usually not treasurable.
A holding cell is usually not teleportable.
A holding cell is usually not extra-accepting.
A holding cell is usually vp-agnostic.
A holding cell is usually magical.

An arena has a room called the staging area.

Section - Having a fight in an Arena

[The challenged opponent is an object that varies;] [the noun]
[The selected arena is an object that varies;] [the second noun]

To have (first guy - a person) and (second guy - a person) fight in (place - an arena):
	try the first guy trying challenging the second guy in the place;

Challenging it in is an action applying to one visible thing and one visible thing.
			
Check an actor challenging someone in (this is the must be enemies to challenge rule):
	unless the person asked opposes the noun:
		stop the action; [silently]
	if the person asked is the noun:
		stop the action; [silently]

Check an actor challenging someone in (this is the player should be the actor when challenging rule):
	if the noun is the player:
		instead try challenging the person asked in the second noun;

Check an actor challenging someone in (this is the NPCs simulate arena battle rule):
	if the person asked is the player:
		continue the action;
	let n be level of the actor plus level of the noun;
	increase n by 4;
	let m be level of the person asked;
	increase m by 2;
	while the person asked is alive and the noun is alive:
		if a random chance of m in n succeeds:  [chance is: LVL1 + 2 / (LVL1 + 2 + LVL2 + 2); creatures of the same level: 1/2; level 4 vs level 3: 6/11; level 4 vs level 2: 6/10; level 4 vs level 0: 6/8.]
			decrease health of the noun by 2;  [bypassing the damage system; this is a very rough approximation anyway]
		otherwise:
			decrease health of the person asked by 2;
	if location of the person asked is location of the player:
		Let the defeated be the noun;
		if the person asked is not alive:
			now the defeated is the person asked;
		say "[The name of the person asked] and [the name of the noun] briefly flicker in and out of existence. When they become solid once more, [bold type][the name of the defeated] has been killed[roman type]!";
	[This is a hack to record the minotaur's death if it mazes an npc. If the noun is killed, its death will be recorded as a result of the minotaur's original hit.]
	if the person asked is dead:
		have an event of the noun killing the person asked;
	stop the action.

The player should be the actor when challenging rule is listed first in the check challenging it in rules.

The must be enemies to challenge rule is listed first in the check challenging it in rules.

The NPCs simulate arena battle rule is listed last in the check challenging it in rules.

Carry out an actor challenging someone in (this is the remember the challenge site rule):
	if the second noun is not the location of the person asked, now the challenge site of the second noun is the location of the person asked;

To reform the group led by (leader - a person):
	if the leader is group leading and the leader is initially accompanied:
		repeat with the guy running through people who accompany the leader:
			unless guy opposes the leader and the leader is defeated individually:
				[Don't move living (or dead) ex-followers -
				The case in mind here is the mindslug: Mouser and Fafhrd shouldn't be removed from the dungeon if the mindslug appears in the Arena of the Fallen. But I've tweaked it so they will come back if they were still mindslug-enslaved when they died, or they somehow come back to the mindslug's side while they're still alive.
				
				Another case to consider is if we enslave and then kill one of the Fanatics of Aite. If this happens, they will come back to the Arena of the Fallen still enslaved to us. I'm not totally sure if this is possible, since the fanatics' power would drive out the enslaving ability - but it might be if the enslaved fanatic were not the last one to die.
				]
				extract the guy from combat;
				move the guy to the location of the leader;

Carry out an actor challenging someone in (this is the place challenged opponents in staging area rule):
	extract the noun from combat;
	move the noun to the staging area of the second noun;
	if the second noun is a challenged-group-inviting arena:
		reform the group led by the noun; 
		
Carry out an actor challenging someone in (this is the impose arena faction rule):
	if the second noun is a faction-imposing arena:
		Repeat with guy running through people in the staging area of the second noun:
			now the faction of guy is arena-faction;

Carry out an actor challenging someone in (this is the arena arrival rule):
	carry out the arena arrival activity with the second noun;

The place challenged opponents in staging area rule is listed first in the carry out challenging it in rules.

The impose arena faction rule is listed last in the carry out challenging it in rules.

The arena arrival rule is listed last in the carry out challenging it in rules.

Arena arrival of something is an activity on objects.

For arena arrival of an arena (called destination) (this is the move the challenger to the arena rule):
	extract the person asked from combat;
	move the person asked to the destination.

Section - Getting out of an Arena

Arena exit of something is an activity on objects.

Last every turn when the location is an arena and the player is alive (this is the check for completed arena battle rule):
	update the combat status;
	while the location is an arena and combat status is peace:
		if the staging area of the location is not the location and someone is in the staging area of the location:
			make no decision;
		[any bugs here, such as failing to exit the arena, can cause infinite loops]
		carry out the arena exit activity with the location;
		update the combat status;

Before arena exit of an arena (called place) (this is the clean up conquered arena rule):
	Now the place is conquered;
	repeat with item running through things in the place:
		unless (the item is the player or the item is a backdrop):
			move item to the challenge site of the place;

For arena exit of an arena (called place) (this is the standard for arena exit rule):
	say "You are [bold type]transported back[roman type] from the [place].";

After arena exit of an arena (called place) (this is the finally return the player from the arena rule):
	[there should never be combat at this point, so we shouldn't need to extract the player from combat]
	move player to the challenge site of the place.

Section - Actions in an Arena

Instead of digging in an arena:
	take no time;
	say "The magical walls resist your efforts at digging.".

A teleport impossible rule (this is the no teleportation in arena rule):
	if the location of the test subject is an arena:
		rule succeeds.

Chapter - Size

Size is a kind of value. The sizes are tiny, small, medium, large, huge and gargantuan.

A thing has a size. A thing is usually medium.

A person has a size called the base size.

Last when play begins (this is the set base size rule):
	repeat with guy running through persons:
		now base size of guy is size of guy.

Understand the size property as describing a weapon.
Understand the size property as describing a person.

Before printing the name of a weapon (called item):
	if item is not medium:
		say "[size of item] ".

Before printing the plural name of a weapon (called item):
	if item is not medium:
		say "[size of item] ".
		
Before printing the name of a shield (called item):
	if item is not medium:
		say "[size of item] ".

Before printing the plural name of a shield (called item):
	if item is not medium:
		say "[size of item] ".		

Status attribute rule (this is the size status rule):
	if player is not medium:
		if long status is true:
			say "Your current size is [bold type][size of the player][roman type][if size of the player is not base size of the player], and your base size is [bold type][base size of the player][roman type][end if].[line break][run paragraph on]";
		otherwise:
			say "[@ check initial position of attribute][size of the player] in stature[run paragraph on]";


[Note: sizes of a person are meant to reflect how big they themselves are. Sizes of objects are meant to reflect for what size person they were meant. Thus, a 'medium dagger' is much smaller than a 'medium bed': both are normal-sized objects as they are made for normal-sized humans. A huge dagger might be about the same size as a medium sword -- it would just be hard to handle for a medium person, because the hilt would be too big to grip with a hand!]

The standard measure is a medium thing. [You can test the size difference of the standard measure and X.]

To decide which number is the size difference of (a - a thing) and (b - a thing):
	if a is medium and b is medium: [most common case, just to speed things up]
		decide on 0;
	let n be 0;
	if a is tiny:
		increase n by 2;
	if a is small:
		increase n by 1;		
	if a is large:
		decrease n by 1;
	if a is huge:
		decrease n by 2;	
	if a is gargantuan:
		decrease n by 3;
	if b is tiny:
		decrease n by 2;
	if b is small:
		decrease n by 1;		
	if b is large:
		increase n by 1;
	if b is huge:
		increase n by 2;	
	if b is gargantuan:
		increase n by 3;
	decide on n.
	
[The resulting number lies between +5 (a is tiny, b is gargantuan) and -5 (a is gargantuan, b is tiny)]

Section - Size and combat

An attack modifier rule (this is the size attack modifier rule):
	if the global defender is not medium:
		if the global defender is tiny:
			say " - 2 (defender tiny)[run paragraph on]";
			decrease the attack strength by 2;
		if the global defender is small:
			say " - 1 (defender small)[run paragraph on]";
			decrease the attack strength by 1;		
		if the global defender is large:
			say " + 1 (defender large)[run paragraph on]";
			increase the attack strength by 1;
		if the global defender is huge:
			say " + 2 (defender huge)[run paragraph on]";
			increase the attack strength by 2;
		if the global defender is gargantuan:
			say " + 3 (defender gargantuan)[run paragraph on]";
			increase the attack strength by 3.

Chance to win rule when the global defender is not medium (this is the CTW defender size bonus rule):
	if the global defender is tiny:
		decrease the chance-to-win by 2;
	if the global defender is small:
		decrease the chance-to-win by 1;		
	if the global defender is large:
		increase the chance-to-win by 1;
	if the global defender is huge:
		increase the chance-to-win by 2;
	if the global defender is gargantuan:
		increase the chance-to-win by 3.

An add specific damage rule (this is the size damage increase rule):
	if damage-by-hitting is true:
		if the global attacker is not medium:
			if the global attacker weapon is not size-agnostic:
				[staff of pain is size-agnostic. If there were another weapon that did non-physical damage, would it do size damage?]
				if the size of the global attacker is:
					-- large:
						add 1 points of physical damage with reason "large attacker";
					-- huge:
						add 2 points of physical damage with reason "huge attacker";
					-- gargantuan:
						add 4 points of physical damage with reason "gargantuan attacker".
						
A remove specific damage rule (this is the size damage decrease rule):
	if damage-by-hitting is true:
		if the global attacker is not medium:
			if the global attacker weapon is not size-agnostic:
				if the size of the global attacker is:
					-- tiny:
						remove 2 points of physical damage with reason "tiny attacker";
					-- small:
						remove 1 points of physical damage with reason "small attacker".
						
An attack modifier rule (this is the weapon size attack modifier rule):
	if global attacker weapon is not size-agnostic:
		if the global attacker weapon is not a natural weapon part of the global attacker:
			let n be the size difference of the global attacker and the global attacker weapon;
			if n is less than 0:
				now n is 0 minus n;
			unless n is 0:
				let n be n times 2;
				decrease n by 1;
				if the numbers boolean is true, say " - [n] (weapon size)[run paragraph on]";
				decrease the attack strength by n.

An attack modifier rule (this is the shield size attack modifier rule):
	if the global defender is at-block:
		let item be a random shield worn by the global defender;
		if item is not size-agnostic:
			let n be the size difference of the global defender and item;
			if n is greater than 0:
				if the numbers boolean is true, say " + [n] (defender using outsized shield)[run paragraph on]";
				increase the attack strength by n;			
			if n is less than 0:
				now n is 0 minus n;
				if the numbers boolean is true, say " + [n] (defender's shield too small)[run paragraph on]";
				increase the attack strength by n.

[No chance to win rule: monsters who start using over- or undersized weapons probably deserve being clumsy.]

Section - Size of Things

To increase the size of (item - a thing):
	unless the size of item is gargantuan:
		now the size of item is the size after the size of item;
		
To decrease the size of (item - a thing):
	unless the size of item is tiny:
		now the size of item is the size before the size of item;
		
Section - Size of weapons

[These operations are now reversible.]

To increase the size of (item - a weapon):
	unless the size of item is gargantuan:
		now the size of item is the size after the size of item;
		unless item is size-agnostic:
			increase weapon damage bonus of item by 1;
			increase damage die of item by 1;
			if size of item is small or size of item is large or size of item is gargantuan:
				decrease parry-against bonus of item by 1;

Chapter - Powers

A power is a kind of object.

A power can be granted. A power is usually not granted.
A power has a number called the power level. The power level of a power is usually 1.
A power has some text called the command text. The command text of a power is usually "".
A power has a text called the description.
A power has a text called the power-name.
A power can be sacrificable. A power is usually sacrificable.

Granting relates one monster to one power. The verb to grant (he grants, they grant, he granted, it is granted, he is granting) implies the granting relation.

Killing rule (this is the grant powers when a monster is slain rule):
	if the killer-guy is the player and the killed-guy is not the player:
		do the absorption with killed-guy.

Every turn (this is the remove all killed monsters from play rule):
	repeat with guy running through dead not off-stage persons:
		unless guy is the player:
			do the absorption with guy.

A person can be already-granted. A person is usually not already-granted.
Every turn (this is the remove already-granted rule):
	repeat with guy running through already-granted people:
		now guy is not already-granted.

To do the absorption with (guy - a person):
	have the guy disappear;
	if the guy is a sole survivor:
		if guy is grouper and guy is not group leading:
			[Is is really necessary to check for group leading? If it is, we should do it elsewhere too]
			now guy is the leader of guy;
		unless guy is already-granted:
			increase score by level of guy;
			now test subject is guy;
			unless absorption is stopped:
				do power transferral with the guy;
				heal fully because the guy is slain;
				now guy is already-granted;
			do achievement awarding for the guy.

To do power transferral with (guy - a person):
	repeat with X running through powers:
		if guy grants X:
			unless X is granted:
				follow the absorbing rules for X;
				now X is granted;
				let n be the power level of X;
				let Z be a list of powers;
				repeat with Y running through granted powers:
					unless X is Y:
						unless power level of Y is greater than the power level of X:
							add Y to Z;
							follow the repelling rules for Y;
							now Y is not granted;
				if the number of entries in Z is greater than 0:
					say "The violence of the absorption drives [Z with definite articles] out of your body. ";
				grant a faculty increase of n.

To heal fully because (guy - a person) is slain:
	if the level of guy is greater than 0 and the level of guy is not 10:
		unless the player is undead:
			say "Absorbing a soul has [bold type]fully healed[roman type] you.";
			fully heal the player;
		otherwise:
			say "Absorbing a soul has [bold type]restored some of your health[roman type].";
			let n be 8 times level of guy;
			heal the player for n health;
	if the level of guy is 10:
		do the level 10 victory with guy.

To have (guy - a person) disappear:
	follow the disappearing rules for guy;
	let X be the holder of guy;
	unless X is nothing:
		repeat with Y running through things had by guy:
			move Y to X;
			if Y is a weapon:
				now Y is not readied;
	remove guy from play.


To do achievement awarding for (guy - a person):
	if level of guy is 1:
		award achievement assistant dungeoneer;
	if level of guy is 2:
		award achievement adventurer;
	if level of guy is 3:
		award achievement hunter;
	if level of guy is 4:
		award achievement destroyer.

Disappearing is a person based rulebook.
Absorbing is a power based rulebook.
Repelling is a power based rulebook.

Section - Greatest power of the player

To decide which number is the greatest power of the player:
	let m be 0;
	if at least one power is granted:
		repeat with X running through granted powers:
			if power level of X is greater than m:
				now m is power level of X;
	decide on m.

Section - Whether absorption is stopped

The absorption stopping rules are a rulebook.

To decide whether absorption is stopped:
	follow the absorption stopping rules;
	if rule succeeded:
		decide yes;
	otherwise:

A weapon can be hand-to-hand, tethered, or projectile. A weapon is usually hand-to-hand.

Definition: A weapon is ranged if it is not hand-to-hand.

Chapter - Armour-stoppable

[Armour should only reduce the damage of some weapons. For instance, armour doesn't help against a lightning bolt or dragon's fire.]

A weapon can be armour-stoppable. A weapon is usually armour-stoppable.

Chapter - Size-agnostic

[Some weapons are not dependent on the user's size for their damage output.]

Understand "wooden" as wood.
Understand "radiant" as radiance.
Understand "adamantine" as adamant.
Understand "vapourous" and "vapor" and "vaporous" as vapour.

The material of a thing is usually other-material.
The material of a person is usually flesh.

A thing has a material called the original material.

Last when play begins (this is the set original material rule):
	repeat with item running through things:

To decide whether (deed - a stored action) is unattacklike:
	if deed is attacklike behaviour, no;
	yes.

Chapter - Doing risky things

[Sometimes, the player can do a risky thing which should allow his enemy to make an attack of opportunity. But we do not want this to be a good way of making your enemy attack before his concentration is high enough -- so we are going to give the enemy a big to-hit bonus when the player is doing something risky.] 

[I don't think we are actually using this right now.]

A person can be risky. A person is usually not risky.

An attack modifier rule (this is the defender is doing something risky rule):
	if the global defender is risky:
		say " + 6 (defender taking risky action)[run paragraph on]";
		increase the attack strength by 6.

Chance to win rule when the global defender is risky (this is the CTW risky bonus rule):

Chapter - Heat

[The heat system currently supports hotness for things. However, giving a hotness to persons is _not_ truly supported, and will lead to unwanted behaviour.]

[Much of the heat system has been turned off. It was too unituitive and punishing. Perhaps also too computation intensive?]

Section - Basics

A thing has a number called the heat strength. The heat strength of a thing is usually 0.

		let n be heat strength of item;
		let m be destroying heat of the material of item;
		if m is not greater than n:
			if material of item is burner and m + 2 is greater than n:
				now item is flaming;

			let n be heat strength of damage-source;
			add n points of heat damage with reason "[damage-source] [are] hot".

Section - Weapons

An aftereffects rule (this is the heat can cause weapons to break rule):
	let n be heat strength of the global attacker weapon;
	let m be heat strength of the global defender weapon;
	if n is greater than 0 and global attacker weapon is not ranged:
		[For now, let's say tethered weapons can't break from heat. It's because they're flexible. Sure.]
		if the global attacker weapon is corruptible:
			if the total damage is greater than 0 or defender is at parry:
				if a random chance of n in 50 succeeds:
					turn off mentioning hotness;			
					say "[The global attacker weapon], weakened by being heated, is [bold type]destroyed[roman type]!";

					remove global attacker weapon from play;
	if the total damage is less than 1 and the defender is at parry:
		if m is greater than 0:

When play begins:
	follow the internal heat rule.

Last every turn (this is the internal heat rule):
	repeat with item running through internally-heated things:
		if heat strength of item is less than internal heat of item:
			now heat strength of item is internal heat of item.

Section - Cooling

A thing can be a cooler. A thing is usually cooler. [If a burn check was made for an item, it will become not cooler than 1, and therefore will not cool down this turn. This stops us from having many repeated messages about something cooling down completely.]

Last every turn (this is the cooling rule):
	repeat with item running through hot not flaming things:
		unless item is not cooler and heat strength of item is 1:
			if heat strength of item is greater than internal heat of item:

To do the burn check with (item - a thing) and strength (n - a number):
	if n is greater than heat strength of item:
		let m be n - heat strength of item;
		if a random chance of m in 3 succeeds and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:

Chapter - Resetting Fighters

Section - To Extract From Combat

Last chance to hit is a truth state that varies.

To extract (guy - a person) from combat, giving enemies a chance to hit:
	if the guy is off-stage, stop;
	if giving enemies a chance to hit and the guy is not hidden:
		now last chance to hit is true;
	follow the sudden combat reset rules for guy;
	now last chance to hit is false;

Section - The Sudden Combat Reset Rules

[After teleportation, and other sudden move actions of the player, concentration and so on ought to be reset. They work on the location of the player, so should be called _before_ the move.]

The sudden combat reset rules are an object based rulebook.

[This could be a whole rulebook in itself...]
To decide whether (fighter - a person) would take a parting shot at (deserter - a person):
	if last chance to hit is false, no;
	unless deserter is the player, no;
	if fighter is the player or fighter is the deserter, no;
	if fighter is non-attacker or fighter is asleep or fighter is not alive, no;
	unless fighter opposes deserter, no;
	if deserter is runner, yes;
	if concentration of fighter is greater than 0, yes;
	if fighter presses deserter or deserter presses fighter, yes;
	no.

A first sudden combat reset rule for a person (called the deserter) (this is the last chance to hit the deserter rule):
	[this rule could use optimizing if things get slow - watch out for teleportation grenades in rooms with hundreds of people!]
	repeat with X running through alive persons in the location of the deserter:
		if X would take a parting shot at the deserter:
			try X hitting the deserter;
			if the deserter is not mobile, rule fails;
		now X does not press the deserter;
		now the deserter does not press X;
	
A last sudden combat reset rule for a person (called the deserter) (this is the sudden reset action stats rule):
	if the deserter is the player:
		repeat with guy running through alive persons enclosed by the location:
			reset combat action stats of the guy;
	if the deserter is not the player or the deserter is dead:
		reset combat action stats of the deserter;

To reset combat action stats of (guy - a person):

	now offensive flow of the guy is 0;
	now defensive flow of the guy is 0;
	now the guy is at-Inactive;
	now the guy is not at dodge;
	now the guy is not at parry;
	now the guy is not at-block;
	clean the table of delayed actions for the guy;

Section - Reviving

[This phrase is used by the smoke demon and Israfel, and in arenas]

A person has a faction called the original faction.

When play begins (this is the remember original factions rule):
	Repeat with guy running through people:
		now the original faction of guy is the faction of guy.

To revive (guy - a person) in (place - a room):
	follow the reviving rules for guy;
	move guy to place.
	
The reviving rules are an object based rulebook.

Reviving rule for a person (called guy) (this is the basic reviving rule):
	reset combat action stats of guy; 
	now guy is not asleep;
	now guy is not rusted;
	now material of guy is original material of guy;
	Let X be a random natural weapon enclosed by guy;
	now material of X is original material of X;
	now the stun count of guy is 0;
	now the stun strength of guy is 0;
	now the size of guy is the base size of guy;
	now the faction of guy is the original faction of guy;
	now guy is unseen;
	now last-seen-location of guy is Null-Room;
	restore the health of guy;

Chapter - Forced action

Forced-action is a truth state that varies. Forced-action is false. [When it is true, we don't say anything about a player's motivation. Currently used for the boots of wandering.]

Every turn (this is the remove forced action rule):
	now forced-action is false.



Chapter - Reflection

[Some checks for hitting should not be carried out when the attack was reflected. Reflection happens during check hitting; should remain true during the check hitting for the reflected attack; and should then be stopped.]

Reflection-attack is a truth state that varies. Reflection-attack is false.

First carry out an actor hitting (this is the reset reflection rule):
	now reflection-attack is false.


Part - Person stuff

Chapter - Seen

[ We don't need the full Epistemology extension - just a single property for people is enough for us. ]

A person can be either seen or unseen. A person is usually unseen.

Every turn (this is the mark people as seen every turn rule):
	now all people in the location are seen;



Chapter - Death blessing and death curse

[This is a SECRET status that the player can receive -- for instance, by reading the symbols of death.]

A person can be death-blessed.
A person can be death-cursed.

A remove general damage rule (this is the death-blessed rule):
	if the victim is death-blessed:
		if a random chance of 1 in 15 succeeds:
			remove 10 points of general damage with reason "blessing of life";
			if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
				now the victim is not death-blessed.

An add specific damage rule (this is the death-cursed rule):
	if victim is death-cursed:
		if a random chance of 1 in 20 succeeds:
			add 10 points of damage with reason "curse of death";
			if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
				now the victim is not death-cursed.

The death-cursed rule is listed last in the add specific damage rules.

Chapter - Falling

[First, we implement a falling check. Default outcome is that a person can fall.]

Falling-test-person is a person that varies.

To decide whether (guy - a person) can fall:
	now falling-test-person is guy;
	follow the falling-test rules;
	if rule succeeded:
		decide no;
	otherwise:
		decide yes.

The falling-test rules are a rulebook.

A falling-test rule (this is the fliers cannot fall rule):
	if falling-test-person is flying and falling-reason is not 2:
		rule succeeds.

A falling-test rule (this is the non-moving persons cannot fall rule):
	unless falling-test-person can move:
		rule succeeds.

A falling-test rule (this is the ethereal persons cannot fall rule):
	if falling-test-person is ethereal:
		rule succeeds.

[Now we calculate the destination, if any.]

Falling destination rule (this is the standard falling destination rule):
	now falling-destination is the room down from falling-place;
	unless falling-destination is a room:
		now falling-destination is the location of falling-guy.

[Triggered by the falling event in Kerkerkruip Events.

Fall begins.
Stage 1: Does anything want to prevent us from falling? PREEMPT FALLING RULE
Stage 2: Does something in the current room want to give a custom effect to falling? FIRST FALLING RULE
Stage 3: Does something in the destination room want to give a custom effect to falling? FALLING RULE
Stage 4: Otherwise, we apply standard damage in the LAST FALLING RULE.]

Falling rule (this is the move the falling person to the destination rule):
	extract falling-guy from combat;
	move falling-guy to falling-destination.

Last falling rule (this is the standard deal falling damage rule):
	unless falling-guy is flying:
		unless falling-guy is ethereal:
			let m be a random number between 2 and 5;
			if falling-reason is 2:
				decrease m by 1; [small bonus for voluntary jumping]
			if a random chance of 1 in 10 succeeds: [make it slightly dangerous]
				increase m by 5;
			deal m points of physical damage;
			have no-source inflict damage on falling-guy, silently;
			if falling-guy is the player:
				say "With a loud smack, you land in [the location], receiving [if total damage is 0] no damage[otherwise][bold type][total damage] damage[roman type][end if].";
				now concentration of player is 0;
				now the take no time boolean is false;
				if player is dead:
					end the story saying "Your death was not particularly heroic.";
			otherwise:
				now concentration of the falling-guy is 0;
				if the location of falling-guy is the location of the player and total damage is not 0:
					say "[The falling-guy] receives [total damage] damage from the fall.";


Chapter - Player forms

[The player can take on different forms: human-form, ghoul, vampire, vampire bat, ...

The variabel "current form" contains the current player form.

In addition, forms are either form-active or not form-active. Active forms are those that a player can switch to -- assuming we have built te code to do so, of course.]

Player form is a kind of value. The player forms are defined by the Table of Form Properties.

A player form has a text called turn-text.
A player form has a creature-type.

Section - Feeding
	
Feeding is an action applying to one carried thing. Understand "feed [something]" and "feed blood to [something]" and "feed [something] blood" as feeding.

Check feeding:
	if blood magic cost of the noun is 0:
		say "You cannot feed [the noun]." instead;
	if blood magic level of the noun is blood magic maximum of the noun:
		say "[The noun] [are] satiated." instead.

Carry out feeding:
	let n be current blood cost of the noun;
	decrease health of the player by n; [bypassing damage system, of course]
	if health of the player is less than 1:
		say "You feed [n] health to [the noun], which is more than your body can handle.";
		end the story saying "Foolish people should not dabble in blood magic.";
	otherwise:
		say "You feed [n] health to [the noun], increasing [their] power[if concentration of the player is greater than 0] (and losing your concentration)[end if]!";
		increase blood magic level of the noun by 1;
		reset the blood timer of the noun;
		now concentration of the player is 0;
		increase total blood magic by n;
		if total blood magic is greater than 49:
			award achievement Give them blood.

After printing the name of a thing (called item) while stock-taking:
	if blood magic cost of item is not 0:
		if blood magic level of item is not blood magic maximum of item:
			say " (can be fed [current blood cost of item] blood)".

Section - Temporary Blood Magic

A thing has a number called the minimum blood timeout. The minimum blood timeout of a thing is usually 1.
A thing has a number called the maximum blood timeout. The maximum blood timeout of a thing is usually 0.
A thing has a number called the blood timer. The blood timer of a thing is usually 0.

To decide whether (item - a thing) has temporary blood magic:
	decide on whether or not the maximum blood timeout of the item is greater than the minimum blood timeout of the item.

Definition: a thing is temporarily blood-enhanced if the blood timer of it is at least 1;

To reset the blood timer of (item - a thing):
	if the item has temporary blood magic and the item is not temporarily blood-enhanced:
		now the blood timer of item is a random number from the minimum blood timeout of the item to the maximum blood timeout of the item.

Every turn (this is the count down blood timers rule):
	if (the main actor is the player) and (the current action is not the action of the player dontparsing):
		Repeat with the item running through temporarily blood-enhanced things:
			decrease the blood timer of the item by 1;
			if the blood timer of the item < 1:
				decrease the blood magic level of the item by 1;
				if the blood magic level of the item < 1:
					if the location of the item is the location, say "The blood power of [the item] wears off completely.";
				otherwise:
					reset the blood timer of the item;
					if the location of the item is the location, say "Some of the blood power of [the item] wears off.";
