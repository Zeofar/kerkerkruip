Book - Treasures





Chapter - Rules for placement

Section - Valuation

Valuation is a kind of value. The valuations are minor, major, epic, unique, special and non-treasure.
[The number of treasures of each valuation which is placed is set at the end of Dungeon Generation.]
[Valuation also determines how far from Entrance Hall a treasure will generally be found.]

A thing has a valuation. A thing is usually non-treasure.

A treasure scoring rule (this is the better treasures farther away rule):
	if considered treasure is major:
		increase current room score by distance of considered room;
	if considered treasure is epic:
		increase current room score by two times distance of considered room;
	if considered treasure is special:
		increase current room score by two times distance of considered room.

The verb to value (it values, they value, it is valuing) implies the valuation property.

Section - Mood

A thing has a mood. The mood of a thing is usually non-mood.
		
A treasure scoring rule (this is the mood rule):
	if mood of considered treasure is mood of considered room:
		increase current room score by 2;
	if mood of considered treasure is non-mood:
		say "BUG: forgot to set mood of [considered treasure].".






Chapter - Treasure packs
		
[Suppose we want to put three potions of X together as a treasure. First, we probably don't want to make all tokens of a type into placeable treasures. Second, how do we get three together? The solution to both is the treasure pack: a dummy item that gets placed, and is then turned into whatever it contains.]

A treasure pack is a kind of container.

Dungeon finish rule (this is the remove treasure packs rule):
	repeat with item running through treasure packs:
		if item is not off-stage:
			let X be a random thing that contains item;
			if the location of item contains item, let X be the location of item; 
			repeat with Y running through things contained by item:
				move Y to X;
			remove item from play.






Chapter - Basic item properties

Section - Incorruptible

[Incorruptible objects are immune from all effects adversely affecting them.]

A thing can be corruptible or incorruptible. A thing is usually corruptible.

Section - Hidden identity

[Some objects appear to be A, but are actually B. In order to do handle this smoothly, including references to it, we just use object A, and replace it with object B as soon as it is used.]

The non-thing is a thing. [This is a dummy object.]
The non-thing is incorruptible.

A thing has a thing called the hidden identity. The hidden identity of a thing is usually the non-thing.
Definition: a thing (called item) is hidden-identifiable if hidden identity of item is not the non-thing.

A thing can be superhidden-identity. A thing is usually not superhidden-identity. [Use this for items that are always used by others, and shoulnd't function as their hidden identity. It bypasses the "hidden identities also revealed by enemies rule".]

Report wearing:
	unless the hidden identity of the noun is the non-thing:
		now the hidden identity of the noun is curse-identified;
		now the player is wearing the hidden identity of the noun;
		set pronouns from the hidden identity of the noun;
		remove the noun from play;
		say "As soon as you put on [the noun], your flesh crawls. You realise that [the noun] [are] actually [bold type][the hidden identity of the noun][roman type]!" instead.

Report readying:
	unless the hidden identity of the noun is the non-thing:
		remove the noun from play;
		now the hidden identity of the noun is curse-identified;

		set pronouns from the hidden identity of the noun;
		say "As soon as you ready [the noun], a chilling feeling goes through your arms. [The noun] [are] actually [bold type][the hidden identity of the noun][roman type]!" instead.

Last dungeon interest rule (this is the hidden identities also revealed by enemies rule):
	repeat with item running through wearable hidden-identifiable not superhidden-identity things:
		if a person wears item:
			let guy be a random person wearing item;
			now guy is wearing hidden identity of item;
			remove item from play;
	repeat with item running through hidden-identifiable weapons:
		if item is readied:
			let guy be a random person enclosing item;
			now guy carries hidden identity of item;

			now item is cursed;
			if generation info is true, say "* Cursed [item].";

Section - Cursed weapons
