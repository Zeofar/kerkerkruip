Chapter - Requesting test objects (not for release)

[ Test objects are things which will be ensured that they are included in the dungeon. There is a console where you can specify them: type ~ in the main menu. ]

Section - Dungeon generation rules

An object can be randomly included, bannedobject, or testobject. An object is usually randomly included.

First resetting the map rule (this is the remove rarity from testobjects rule):
	repeat with item running through testobject rooms:
		now rarity of item is 0;
		now item is basic;
	repeat with item running through testobject things:
		now rarity of item is 0;
		now item is basic;

A placement possible rule (this is the don't place banned rooms rule):
	if considered room is bannedobject:
		rule fails;

A placement scoring rule (this is the testobject placement scoring rule):
	if considered room is testobject:
		increase current room score by 100;

Last creating the map rule (this is the place all secret testobject rooms rule):
	while there is a secretly placeable not placed testobject room (called place):
		put place in a near location;

A map approval rule (this is the reject map if not all testobject rooms are placed rule):
	if a testobject room is not placed:
		if generation info is true, say "Required for testing, but not placed: [The list of not placed testobject rooms]. ";
		rule fails.

A monster placement possible rule (this is the prefer testobject monsters rule):
	if considered monster is bannedobject:
		rule fails;
	repeat with guy running through testobject off-stage monsters:
		if level of guy is global monster level:
			if considered monster is not testobject:
				rule fails.
		
A monster placement scoring rule (this is the testobject monster scoring rule):
	if considered monster is testobject:
		increase current monster score by 100.

First treasure placement rule (this is the remove bannedobject treasures rule):
	Repeat with item running through not non-treasure things:
		if item is bannedobject, now item is non-treasure.

Last treasure placement rule (this is the place non-person testobjects rule):
	if generation info is true, print generation message "    Placing testobjects...";
	now all off-stage testobject things are in the Entrance Hall;

First dungeon interest rule (this is the ban extra scenery rule):
	Now every bannedobject thing is not extra.
		
Section - The test object file

The File of Test Objects is called "KerkerkruipTestObjects".

Table of Requested Test Objects
Object name (indexed text)
with 100 blank rows

Before showing the title screen (this is the load the file of test objects rule):
	if File of Test Objects exists:
		read File of Test Objects into the Table of Requested Test Objects;

After showing the title screen (this is the mark test objects from file rule):
	let test text be an indexed text;
	repeat through the Table of Requested Test Objects:
		repeat with R running through rooms:
			now test text is "[printed name of R]";
			if the Object name entry is test text:
				now R is testobject;
				break;
		repeat with R running through things:
			now test text is "[printed name of R]";
			if the Object name entry is test text:
				if R is cloneable:
					let new toy be a new object cloned from R;
					now new toy is testobject;
					now new toy is in the Entrance Hall;
				otherwise:
					now R is testobject;
				break;

Last when play begins rule (this is the identify test object scrolls rule):
	repeat with T running through testobject scrolls in the Entrance Hall:
		identify T;

Section - The test object console

The early in turn sequence flag is a truth state variable. The early in turn sequence flag variable translates into I6 as "EarlyInTurnSequence".
The test object console is a truth state variable.

Definition: a number is console:
	if it is 96, yes;
	if it is 126, yes;
	no.
Menu command console:
	follow the show the console rule;
	redraw the menu;

[ By utilising the parse command rule we can use the parser without actually running any actions. Convenient! ]

Adding is an action applying to one visible thing.
Understand "add [any thing]" as adding while the test object console is true.
Understand "add [any room]" as adding while the test object console is true.

Deleting is an action applying to one visible thing.

Understand "empty" as emptying while the test object console is true.

This is the show the console rule:
	open up the status window;
	now the early in turn sequence flag is true;
	now the test object console is true;
	while 1 is 1:
		clear the main window;
		say "[bold type]The following things will be forcibly included in dungeons:[roman type][paragraph break]";
		repeat through the Table of Requested Test Objects:
			say "[the Object name entry][line break]";
		say "[line break]Commands: ADD THING, DELETE THING, EMPTY (the whole list), QUIT[paragraph break]";
		follow the parse command rule;
		set the parser variables manually;
		if quitting the game:
			break;
		if emptying:
			blank out the whole of Table of Requested Test Objects;
		if adding:
			choose a blank row in Table of Requested Test Objects;
			now the Object name entry is the printed name of the noun;
		if deleting:
			repeat through the Table of Requested Test Objects:
				if the Object name entry is the printed name of the noun:
					blank out the whole row;
					break;
		if test queueing or all-test queueing:
			try the current action;
	write File of Test Objects from Table of Requested Test Objects;
	now the early in turn sequence flag is false;
	now the test object console is false;
	shut down the status window;

[ Unfortunately these variables are set in the Generate Action Rule. Not to worry, we can set them ourselves! ]
To set the parser variables manually:
	(- action = parser_results-->ACTION_PRES; noun = parser_results-->INP1_PRES; -).

Rule for constructing the status line while the test object console is true:
	fill status bar with Table of Console Status;
	rule succeeds;
