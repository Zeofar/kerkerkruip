Chapter - Retreating


Section - Retreating action

Retreating is an action applying to nothing.
Understand "retreat" and "flee" and "run away" as retreating.

A person can be a retreater. A person is usually not a retreater.

The retreat location is a room that varies. The retreat location is the entrance hall.

[A resetting the dungeon rule (this is the reset retreating rule):
	now retreat location is Entrance Hall;
	now the player is not retreater.]

First carry out going (this is the set retreat location rule):
	now the retreat location is the location.

Check retreating (this is the cannot retreat when no retreat location rule):
	if the retreat location is nothing:
		take no time;
		say "There is nowhere to retreat to." instead.

Check retreating (this is the cannot retreat when in the retreat location rule):
	if the retreat location is the location:
		take no time;
		say "There is nowhere to retreat to." instead.
		
Check retreating when the combat status is peace (this is the cannot retreat when there are no enemies rule):
	take no time;
	say "There's nothing here to retreat from." instead.
		
Check an at-React pc retreating (this is the cannot retreat as reaction rule):
	take no time;
	say "You cannot retreat as a reaction--try to survive and run away on your own turn." instead.

Carry out retreating (this is the standard carry out retreat rule):
	now the player is retreater;
	let way be the best route from location to retreat location;
	try going way; [See going in combat below]
	now the player is not retreater.


Section - Allow the player a free retreat whenever he first enters a room

[We implement this by automatically having the player win initiative -- which is a nice thing to do anyway. But only the first time he enters a room!]

A room can be initiative-conferring. A room is usually initiative-conferring.

[A resetting the dungeon rule (this is the reset initiative-conferring rule):
	repeat with place running through rooms:
		now place is initiative-conferring.]

Initiative update rule (this is the player wins initiative first time in a room rule):
	if the location is initiative-conferring:
		increase the initiative of the player by 10;
		now the location is not initiative-conferring.


Section - Going in combat

Check going (this is the cannot go as a reaction rule):
	if the combat state of the player is at-React:
		take no time;
		say "You cannot move as a reaction--try to survive and move away on your own turn." instead.

Last check going (this is the treat going as retreat when possible rule):
	if the player is not retreater and the combat status is not peace:
		let way be the direction from location to retreat location;
		if noun is way:
			try retreating instead.



A person can be a runner. A person is usually not a runner.

Last check going (this is the going and retreating during combat rule):
	let current-location be the location;
	if the player is not hidden and the combat status is not peace:
		if player is retreater:
			unless forced-action is true:
				say "[if all enemies are asleep]You sneak back[otherwise]Deciding that discretion is the better part of valour, you bravely run away[end if].";
		otherwise:			
			unless forced-action is true:
				say "[if all enemies are asleep]You sneak past your enemies[otherwise]You decide to run past your enemies[end if].";
			now the player is runner;
		extract the player from combat, giving enemies a chance to hit;
		now the player is not runner;
		now the player is not retreater;				
		if the player is not mobile:
			do nothing instead;
		if location is not current-location:
			do nothing instead. [Something has changed the location, and we shouldn't do the move. For example, being mazed by the minotaur while retreating.]

Check looking when the player is dead:
	do nothing instead.

An attack modifier rule (this is the running is risky rule):
	if the global defender is a runner pc:
		say " + 3 (you are running)[run paragraph on]";
		increase the attack strength by 3.

An add specific damage rule (this is the running is very risky rule):
	if damage-by-hitting is true:
		if the victim is a runner pc:
			add 1 points of physical damage with reason "you are running".





Chapter - Going to

Going to is an action applying to one object.
Understand "go to [any visited room]" and "go [any visited room]" and "[any visited room]" as going to.
Understand "go to [any seen person]" and "go [any seen person]" and "[any seen person]" as going to.

Going to is bypassing-scope.

Does the player mean going to a not alive person: it is unlikely.
[ Should we also allow going to things? ]

Null-Room is a room. "You should never see this text. That would be a BUG." Null-Room is not placeable.

The location-to-go is a room that varies. The location-to-go is Null-Room.

Check going to a room:
	if the noun is the location:
		take no time;
		say "You're already here." instead.
		
Check going to a thing:
	if the location of the noun is the location:
		take no time;
		say "[They]['re] right here!" instead.

Definition: a room (called place) is safe if place is safe-1 and place is not nogo.
Definition: a room (called place) is safe-1 if the number of alive hater persons in place is 0 or place is the location or place is location-to-go. [We do not count the starting and end points.]

Definition: a person (called guy) is hater if the guy opposes the player.

Carry out going to a room:
	now location-to-go is the noun;
	let way be the best route from the location of player to the noun through visited safe rooms;
	unless way is a direction:
		take no time;
		say "You don't know how to go there safely." instead;
	try going way instead.

Carry out going to a thing:
	now location-to-go is the last-seen-location of the noun;
	let way be the best route from the location of player to location-to-go through visited safe rooms;
	unless way is a direction:
		take no time;
		say "You don't know a safe path towards [regarding the noun][them]." instead;
	say "You last saw [the noun] in [the location-to-go], so you [one of]strike out[or]head[at random] towards there.";
	try going way instead;

Shorter going to is an action applying to nothing. Understand "go to" and "go on" as shorter going to.

Instead of shorter going to:
	if location-to-go is Null-Room:
		take no time;
		say "Unable to go automatically: you haven't provided a destination yet. Please use a command like 'go to Entrance Hall' or 'go to Malygris' first.";
	otherwise:
		try going to the location-to-go.

[And now, mapping the empty command to "go to". Not easy, we need an ugly I6 substitution.]

After reading a command (this is the blank line is go to rule):
	let T be indexed text;
	now T is the player's command;
	if T is "", change the text of the player's command to "go to".

[Finally, we want to empty the go-to location once we have reached it.]

Last report going (this is the check whether destination reached rule):
	if the location is the location-to-go:

Chapter - Status

Asking status is an action out of world. Understand "status" and "stat" and "stats" as asking status.

Carry out asking status (this is the show basic stats rule):

The status combat stats rules are a rulebook.
The status attribute rules are a rulebook.

Remembering is an action out of world. Understand "memory" and "remember" and "r" as remembering.

Check remembering:

Section - Sensing

Sensing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "sense" as sensing.

[Sensing is acting fast.] [This makes the demon assassin a lot more fun, because you now have to decide whether or not you want to sense Malygris often.]

Check sensing (this is the do not sense when not in the dungeon rule):
	if x-coordinate of the location is 100:
		take no time;
		say "You do not seem to be in the dungeon, so your sensing power doesn't work." instead.

To decide whether (guy - a person) is soul-reflected:
	if level of guy is not 0:
		decide no;
	otherwise:
		let place be location of guy;
		repeat with guy2 running through people in place:
			if level of guy2 > 0:
				decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: A person (called guy) is psycholocation-revealed:
	if guy is the player, no;
	if guy is not denizen, no;
	if the level of guy is greater than 0, yes;
	if guy is soul-reflected, yes;
	no.

Carry out sensing when psycholocation is active:
	take no time;

		let count be 0;
		repeat with adversary running through psycholocation-revealed persons:
			increment count;
			if the location of the player is the location of the adversary:
				say " - [italic type]the soul of [the adversary][roman type] here with you, like [soul description of adversary][line break]";
			otherwise:
				say " - [italic type][soul description of adversary][roman type], [soul directions to adversary][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "Your psycholocation doesn't seem to work in your current location.".

To decide what object is the point of departure for (place - a room):
	Let the last point be the location;
	while the last point is not the place:
		Let the way be the best route from the last point to the place;
		if the way is not a direction:
			decide on nothing;
		Let the next point be the room way from the last point;
		If the next point is not visited:
			decide on the last point;
		Now the last point is the next point;
	decide on the last point;

To say soul directions to (adversary - a person):
	Let the destination be the location of the adversary;
	if the destination is a visited room:
		say "in [place-memory of the destination]";
		stop;

	if the waystation is a room and the waystation is not the location:
		say "[best route from the waystation to the destination] from [the waystation] (which lies [the road to the waystation] from here)";
		stop;
	let the way be the best route from the location to the destination;
	if way is a direction:
		say "[if way is not up and way is not down]from the [end if][way]";
	otherwise:
		say "somewhere [general direction from location of the player to location of the adversary]";

Carry out sensing when psycholocation is inactive:		
	if greatest power of the player is less than 3:
		take no time;
		say "You are not yet powerful enough to magically sense anything.";
	if greatest power of the player is greater than 2:
		let the way be the best route from the location of player to the location of Malygris;
		if way is a direction:
			say "You feel that the shortest route towards Malygris lies [way].[line break]";
		otherwise:
			if the location of the player is the location of Malygris:
				say "Malygris is right here.[line break]";
			otherwise:
				say "There seems to be no available route towards Malygris.[line break]";

Carry out sensing:
	if player is denizen:
		if greatest power of the player is greater than 3:
			now world test subject is player;
			repeat with item running through worldsharer epic things:
				if location of item is not location of the player and location of item is placed:
					say "[line break]You sense an epic artefact that [directions to location of item].[line break]";
					

To say directions to (destination - a room):
	let the way be the best route from the location of player to destination;
	if way is a direction:
		say "can be found by going [way] from here";
	otherwise:
		say "is currently unreachable, but lies somewhere [general direction from location of the player to destination]".
	
To say general direction from (place1 - a room) to (place2 - a room):
	let K be a list of directions;
	if x-coordinate of place1 is less than x-coordinate of place2:
		add north to K;
	if x-coordinate of place1 is greater than x-coordinate of place2:
		add south to K;
	if y-coordinate of place1 is less than y-coordinate of place2:
		add east to K;
	if y-coordinate of place1 is greater than y-coordinate of place2:
		add west to K;
	if z-coordinate of place1 is less than z-coordinate of place2:
		add up to K;
	if z-coordinate of place1 is greater than z-coordinate of place2:
		add down to K;
	say "[K]".

	otherwise:
		say "The following beings have been vanquished:";
		repeat with guy running through dead seen persons:
			say "[line break]- [italic type][the name of the guy][roman type] (level [if group level of the guy is not 0][group level of the guy][otherwise][level of the guy][end if])";
