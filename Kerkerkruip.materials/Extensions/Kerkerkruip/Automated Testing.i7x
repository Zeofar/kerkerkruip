Automated Testing by Kerkerkruip begins here.

Use authorial modesty.

[Using outcomes only:

To queue a test, make its final dependency possible

To run test, trace dependencies backwards, then run them in forwards order

How to distinguish branching dependencies from dependencies that are used in two different places? Use 'reusable' property?

two ways to run tests - implicitly or explicitly. Maybe branching dependencies need to be explicit

special outcomes: taking a turn, restarting for tests

taking a turn sets an action - either player or npc

By default every outcome depends on its predecessor?

To compel (action) - take a turn
To react to (person) with (action) - take a turn with attack/react rounds
To wait for (person) to act

Volume - Test Framework (not for release)

Include Simple Unit Tests by Dannii Willis.
Include Text Capture by Eric Eve. [Actually, this must be included before Basic Screen Effects]

Use maximum capture buffer length of at least 16384.
Use maximum text length of at least 16384.

Chapter - Randomized Events

Section - Outcomes

[TODO: put all outcomes in a table and save it to a file. Then we can restart the game repeatedly and use outcomes to generate statistics about dungeon generation]
An outcome is a kind of value. Some outcomes are defined by the Table of outcomes.

To say (result - an outcome):
	if the description of the result is not empty:
		say "[description of the result]";
	otherwise:
		say "[the result]";
		
outcome state is a kind of value. The outcome states are outcome-untested, outcome-possible, outcome-failed, and outcome-achieved.

Definition: an outcome is resolved if the state of it is at least outcome-failed.
Definition: an outcome is untested if the state of it is outcome-untested.
Definition: an outcome is possible if the state of it is outcome-possible.
Definition: an outcome is failed if the state of it is outcome-failed.
Definition: an outcome is achieved if the state of it is outcome-achieved.

An outcome can be unscheduled, scheduled for immediate testing, scheduled for later testing, just-tested, or just-succeeded.
	
[Outcome properties:

description - a 'printed name' style text
attempt count - number of times outcome has been tested
success count - number of times a test "succeeded"
likelihood -
minimum attempts -

The probability of a test "succeeding" should be likelihood / minimum attempts.

This has some special interpretations:
	
if likelihood = 0 or likelihood = minimum attempts, then success or failure of each test is considered a certainty, and the whole outcome will fail if a single test does not perform as expected
if minimum attempts = 0, then likelihood is considered a minimum number of successes, not a probability. Setting likelihood to 1 means the whole outcome will be achieved if a single test succeeds
For all other values, a tolerance range will be established that should achieve the outcome in 99% of cases with correctly randomized successes

maximum attempts - outcome will "time out" and fail if it reaches this number without being achieved first. If you don't set this, a reasonable default will be chosen for you
maximum tolerance - do not set, will be calculated
state - determines whether the outcome should be tested. do not set directly, use "make ... possible" phrases, etc
dependency - determines whether the next outcome should be tested. do not set directly, use "serial outcome dependency" phrases

Section - Outcome Persistence

The file of test outcomes is called "testoutcomes"

To save test outcomes:
	Repeat through Table of Outcomes:
		now the description entry is the description of the outcome entry;
		now the attempt count entry is the attempt count of the outcome entry;
		now the success count entry is the success count of the outcome entry;
		now the likelihood entry is the likelihood of the outcome entry;
		now the minimum attempts entry is the minimum attempts of the outcome entry;
		now the maximum attempts entry is the maximum attempts of the outcome entry;
		now the state entry is the state of the outcome entry;
		now the antecedent entry is the antecedent of the outcome entry;
		[ingore maximum tolerance, it will be recalculated]
	write file of test outcomes from table of outcomes;
	
To load test outcomes:
	unless file of test outcomes exists, stop;
	Read file of test outcomes into table of outcomes;
	Repeat through table of outcomes:
		[skip description entry]
		if there is an attempt count entry, now the attempt count of the outcome entry is the attempt count entry;
		if there is a success count entry, now the success count of the outcome entry is the success count entry;
		if there is a likelihood entry, now the likelihood of the outcome entry is the likelihood entry;
		if there is a minimum attempts entry, now the minimum attempts of the outcome entry is the minimum attempts entry;
		if there is a maximum attempts entry, now the maximum attempts of the outcome entry is the maximum attempts entry;
		[ingore maximum tolerance, it will be recalculated]
		if there is a state entry, now the state of the outcome entry is the state entry;
		if there is an antecedent entry, now the the antecedent of the outcome entry is the antecedent entry;

Section - Statistical Help

[This phrase helps us set a reasonable error tolerance of repeated tests so they will succeed most of the time. If we use a success rate of 0.99, that will set a threshold of error such that the outcome will be achieved for 99% of random seeds]

To set the maximum tolerance for (event - an outcome) with (success rate - a real number) achievement:
	if minimum attempts of event is 0 or likelihood of event is 0 or likelihood of event is minimum attempts of event:
		now maximum tolerance of event is 0;
	otherwise:
		Let success-target be (likelihood of event * maximum attempts of event) / (minimum attempts of event);
		Let P be (likelihood of event) / (minimum attempts of event * 1.0);
		Let current rate be 0.0;
		Let current threshold be 0;
		while current rate < success rate:
			increase current rate by the probability of winning (success-target + current threshold) times out of maximum attempts of event with likelihood P;
			if current threshold > 0:
				increase current rate by the probability of winning (success-target - current threshold) times out of maximum attempts of event with likelihood P;
			increment current threshold;
		now the maximum tolerance of event is current threshold - 1;
			
To decide what real number is the probability of winning (K - a number) times out of (N - a number) with likelihood (P - a real number):
	if K < 0 or K > N:
		decide on 0.0;
	let product be 1.0;
	[probability = N choose K * P(success)^N * P(failure)^(K-N)]
	[N choose K method cribbed from Wikipedia page on the binomial coefficient]
	[interspersed with multiplying by P and 1 - P to prevent the number from getting too big or too small]
	Repeat with i running from 1 to K:
		now product is product * (n + 1 - i) / (i * 1.0);
		now product is product * P;
		if i is not greater than (N - K):
			now product is product * (1 - P);
	Repeat with i running from (K + 1) to (N - K):
		now product is product * (1 - P);
	decide on product;
		
[
To decide what real number is (N - a number) choose (K - a number):
	Let the product be 1.0;
	Repeat with i running from 1 to K:
		now product is product * (n + 1 - i) / (i * 1.0);
	decide on product;

	Let the current destination be the location-target of the current move;
	if the current destination is nothing, decide on Null-room;
	if the current destination is a room, decide on the current destination;
	decide on the location of the current destination.

Definition: an outcome is schedule-blocking if it is at least taking a turn and it is at most free npc action.

Regular scheduling of a schedule-blocking outcome (called the event) (this is the regular block scheduling rule):
	now the event is scheduled for later testing.
	
[TODO: make this work]
For taking a player action when the scheduled event is not boring lack of results (this is the move to the destination of an outcome rule):
	if the player is at-React:

	if the location-to-go is the location:
		update event description because "arrived at destination [the location] for";
	if the location-to-go is Null-room or the location-to-go is the location:

Section - Testing Outcomes

[TODO: Normalize regex matches against event description so we can use a brief consistent phrase. ]

To decide whether (event - an outcome) timed out:
	decide on whether or not the attempt count of the event is not less than the maximum attempts of the event;
	
To decide whether (event - restarting for tests) timed out: no.
		
To decide what number is the expected successes of (event - an outcome) after (attempts - a number):
	if the minimum attempts of the event is 0, decide on likelihood of the event;
	decide on (likelihood of the event * attempts) / minimum attempts of the event;

The failure report is a text that varies;
	
To resolve (event - an outcome):
	Let the tolerance be the maximum tolerance of the event;
	Let target be the expected successes of the event after the maximum attempts of the event;
	let the upper bound be target + tolerance;
	let the lower bound be (target - tolerance)  - maximum attempts of the event + attempt count of the event;
	if the success count of the event is less than the lower bound or the success count of the event is greater than the upper bound:
		[achievement is impossible within the maximum number of attempts]
		now the state of event is outcome-failed;
		if the failure report is empty:
			now the failure report is "After [attempt count of the event] attempt[s], [the event] happened [success count of the event] times (not between [lower bound] and [upper bound] of target [target] for maximum attempts [maximum attempts of event] with tolerance [tolerance])";
		assert failure report based on false;
	otherwise if the attempt count of the event is at least the minimum attempts of the event:
		now the tolerance is (tolerance * attempt count of the event) / maximum attempts of the event;
		now target is expected successes of the event after the attempt count of the event;
		now the upper bound is the target + tolerance;
		now the lower bound is the target - tolerance;
		if likelihood of the event is at least 1 and lower bound is less than 1:
			say "Programming error: I don't think this code should be needed.";
			now lower bound is 1;
		if the success count of the event is at least lower bound and the success count of the event is at most upper bound:
			now the state of event is outcome-achieved;
			if the event is not preset, assert "success" based on true;

[
failure tolerance: no way end result will be within tolerance.

eg 1 in 15 with 200 attempts
success-target=13
tolerance=9
maximum failures=200-13-9=178
(max success=22, min success=4)

necessary success = min success - maximum attempts + attempts
at 196 attempts:
4 - 200 + 196 = 0
at 197:
4 - 200 + 197 = 1
]
	
To resolve dependents of (event - an outcome):
	if the state of the event is outcome-failed or the event timed out:
		if the event has unresolved dependents:
			Repeat with item running through outcomes:
				if item is not resolved and item depends on event:
					[if the event failed, dependents fail silently. If the event succeeded, they fail noisily]
					if state of the event is outcome-achieved, assert "[item] ([success count of item]/[attempt count of item]) stalled because [event] timed out after [attempt count of event - 1] attempt[s]" based on false;
					now state of item is outcome-failed;

To test (event - an outcome) against (success - a truth state):
	make the event testable;
	[transcribe "DEBUG: test [event] against [success]";]
	increment attempt count of the event;
	if success is true:
		increment success count of the event;
	if event is resolved:
		resolve dependents of the event;
	otherwise:
		resolve event;
	[There is a subtle conflict between "success count" and "just-succeeded". "success count" is the number of times the "success" condition was met. However, if likelihood is 0, this is not really a success - it will result in a positive "error" during resolution. On the other hand, just-succeeded is only true if we got a desirable result, even if that result is false (as it should be in the case of likelihood=0). Feel free to suggest better names for these two variables]
	if success is (whether or not likelihood of the event is greater than 0):
		now the event is just-succeeded;
	otherwise:
		now the event is just-tested;

To test (event - an outcome) against (T - a text):
	update the event description because "testing [event] against '[T]'"; [todo - roll this into a text-testing phrase?]
	[TODO: include event description in failure report]
	test event against whether or not the event description matches the regular expression T;

	now likelihood of event is 0;
	test event against result;
		
To fail (event - an outcome) on result (T - a text):
	[TODO: don't test regexp if we're going to ignore the test result]
	update the event description;
	fail event based on whether or not the event description matches the regular expression T;

testing effects rules are an outcome based rulebook.

Section - Controlling Outcomes

The dependency test root is an outcome that varies. The dependency test root is boring lack of results.

[The phrase below returns true if another outcome depends on the event, and also sets the dependency test outcome so we can use the "dependent" adjective

Dependency is defined differently for different outcomes. In effect, the dependency tree has two segments:
	
an unbranching "trunk" of preset outcomes, ending at the scheduled event
a branching tree of outcomes, all rooted at the scheduled event

Everything in the full tree except for the scheduled outcome is "scheduled anonymously" - i.e. the tree is identified by scheduled event only.

When scheduling happens, everything in the "trunk" will be manually made possible. No other branches should be followed, even though many preset outcomes have multiple dependents. But all the branches of the scheduled event should be made possible. This phrase reflects that: preset outcomes only search for possible dependents, while non-preset outcomes follow all branches of "not resolved" dependents.
]

To decide whether (event - an outcome) has unresolved dependents:
	repeat with item running through outcomes:
		if item currently depends on event, yes;
	no.
	
To decide whether (event - an outcome) depends on (blocker - an outcome):
	Let candidate be the event;
	while candidate is not boring lack of results:
		now candidate is the antecedent of the candidate;
		[We don't check for cyclical dependencies. Beware!]
		if candidate is blocker:
			decide yes;
	decide no.
	
To decide whether (event - an outcome) currently depends on (blocker - an outcome):
	unless event depends on blocker, no;
	if the blocker is preset:
		decide on whether or not event is possible;
	otherwise:
		decide on whether or not event is not resolved;
	
To decide what number is the calculated maximum attempts of (event - an outcome):
	unless maximum attempts of event is 0:
		decide on the maximum attempts of event;
	if minimum attempts of event is 1:
		decide on 1;
	otherwise:
		decide on 100;
	
To make (event - an outcome) testable:
	if event is untested:
		now state of event is outcome-possible;
		now maximum attempts of event is the calculated maximum attempts of event;
		set the maximum tolerance for event with 0.99 achievement;

To make (event - boring lack of results) testable:
	do nothing;
		
Definition: an outcome is test set if the antecedent of it is restarting for tests.
Definition: an outcome is test step if it is not preset and the antecedent of it is boring lack of results.

Definition: An outcome is enabled if it is a test set.

The first test set is an outcome that varies. The first test set is boring lack of results.
The next test set is an outcome that varies.

To find test sets:
	[TODO: do this at start of game?]
	Let item be boring lack of results;
	while the first test set is boring lack of results:
		now item is the outcome after item;
		if item is a test set, now the first test set is item;
	while the primary outcome is boring lack of results and item is not boring lack of results:
		[increment after, because the primary outcome could be the first test set]
		if item is a possible test set, now the primary outcome is item;
		now item is the outcome after item;
	while the next test set is boring lack of results and item is not boring lack of results:
		if item is a test set, now the next test set is item;
		now item is the outcome after item;
		
To decide which outcome is the test set of (event - an outcome):
	if the first test set is boring lack of results:
		find test sets;
	if event is less than the first test set:
		decide on boring lack of results;
	if event is at least the primary outcome:
		if the next test set is boring lack of results or event is less than the next test set:
			decide on the primary outcome;
	While event is not boring lack of results and event is not a test set:
		now event is the outcome before event;
	decide on event;

Definition: An outcome (called event) is preset:
	if the first test set is boring lack of results:

Section - Scheduling

To decide whether testing (T - an outcome):
	if T is already scheduled, yes;
	if done testing is true, no;

Definition: boring lack of results is pending: no.]

[use this phrase for outcomes that might not be possible yet, but should be]
[We must be aware of the special meaning of "boring lack of results" when it is an antecedent. It gives default behavior to outcomes,
but default behavior is different depending on whether an outcome is preset or not.

Preset outcomes that depend on boring lack of results are independent - they have no blockers.

Non-preset outcomes that depend on boring lack of results follow sequential behavior. In practice, they are blocked by the outcome that comes before them AND by the entire dependency tree attached to that outcome. 

This is complicated by the fact that outcomes depending on "restarting for tests" are considered primary - playthroughs that start when the game is rebooted and end when the next test set is encountered. The primary outcome is set when we reboot. We can't run a sequential step unless its immediate precursor belongs to the same primary outcome.

Most of these rules are unimportant except when starting the game. At that point we must search through all the outcomes until we find the primary outcome.]

Chapter - Commands to Start Tests

Test queueing is an action out of world applying to one outcome. Understand "queue test [outcome]" as test queueing.

Carry out test queueing an outcome:
	say "[The outcome understood] will run now.";
	queue the outcome understood;
	start test transcript with "[the outcome understood]";
	
All-test queueing is an action out of world applying to nothing. Understand "queue test all" as all-test queueing.

Carry out all-test queueing:
	queue all automated tests;
	say "All automated tests will run now.";
	start test transcript with "all tests".
		
To start test transcript with (T - a text):
	unless the file of noninteractive tests exists:
		pause the game;
	write "Test transcript for Kerkerkruip: [T].[line break]" to file of test transcript;
	start the next test;
	
	
Understand "queue test/tests" and "queue test [text]" as a mistake ("You can 'queue test all' or test one of the following sets: [list automated tests]").

To say list automated tests:
	repeat with T running through enabled outcomes:
		say "[line break][T]";
	say paragraph break.

Automated Testing ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Basics

Section: Introduction

Kerkerkruip Automated Testing provides a framework for creating detailed playthroughs and testing that they behave as expected. Each playthrough, called a "test set" starts before dungeon generation and goes turn by turn until we run out of tests. A summary of tests will be output in the game console, but a detailed transcript will also be written to a file called "testtranscript."

Kerkerkrup Automated Testing is built on the foundation of Simple Unit Tests by Dannii Willis, and makes heavy use of Text Capture by Eric Eve.

Section: Invoking Tests

To run the tests, enter the command

	> QUEUE TEST ALL
	
to run all test sets, or

	> QUEUE TEST TARGET-SET
	
to run the target test set. Entering an invalid value of TARGET-SET will produce an error listing all possible test sets.

The queue test commands can also be run from the debug console (press ~ when in the opening menu), but no error messages are shown from the console at the time of this writing (2015-02-27).

Section: Assertions

To perform the tests, we have a wide variety of assertion phrases.

First, there's a simple "X is Y" assertion, but we give it a label so the output will be clear about what we're comparing:

	assert that the body score of the player is 5 with label "body score of the player";

If we aren't looking for exact equality, we can use a range:

	assert that the body score of the player is between 4 and 6 with label "body score of the player";
	
and we can test any truth state:

	assert "the body score of the player should be at least 5, but it is [body score of the player]" based on whether or not the body score of the player is at least 5;

We can also test the text that is output by the game, using regular expressions:
	
	assert result "'Do not be afraid, for I will end your suffering!' the Reaper exclaims\.";
	
	assert absence of result "Having been in contact with the scythe of oxidation, the lion's shield rusts\.";

Under the hood, these phrases are managing a text called the "event description." This text accumulates from the captured text, and is normally cleared at the beginning of each turn. To manually clear it, we can say:
	
	clear event description

and we can also force it to update immediately with any text that has just been captured:
	
	update event description
	
These commands cause debug messages to be written to the transcript file, so to help make the file more readable, we can say what's going on when we invoke them:
	
	clear event description because "about to examine the amulet";
	try examining the amulet;
	update event description because "testing amulet description";
	
Once we have updated the event description, we can test it (or any text) with the "includes" assertion:
	
	assert that the event description includes "Feeding \d+ blood to the amulet will increase its power by \d+";

	assert that the damage description does not include "\+ \d+ \(heat\)";
	
There are more ways to perform related sets of assertions, which we will examine later.

Section: Test Sets

To make a test, we create a "test set:"

	bug-xyz is a test set.

Each test set will start a fresh game with a new dungeon. We can use the phrase "when testing bug-xyz" in our rules.

There is a rulebook that runs before dungeon generation called the scenario rules. We can use this to set things as testobject just as if we had forced them to be included from the console. We can also set them as bannedobject, to prevent them from appearing in the dungeon.

	Scenario when testing bug-xyz:
		now the swarm of daggers is testobject;
		now the Hall of Mirrors is bannedobject;

Section: Test Steps

To have things happen on a turn-by-turn basis, create a "test step," or more than one. A test step is a kind of value, and they run in the order that they were declared in the source. We must specify which test step is the first one of the test set, and the rest will follow automatically:

	starting-out is a test step. The first move of bug-xyz is starting-out.

	second-move is a test step.

A test step corresponds to a turn, or multiple turns. It has a few rulebooks. The main ones are "initial scheduling" and "testing effects." These are test-step based rulebooks. There are also "choosing a player action" and "choosing a player reaction," which we will need if we want to actually do anything during a turn.

Section: Initial scheduling

	initial scheduling of starting-out:
    		now the defence of the player is 100.

Initial scheduling runs as soon as the test step first becomes active, and it doesn't run again even if the step repeats.

Section: Rescheduling

We can use rescheduling rules if there is anything we need to do when a test step repeats (see later for how that can happen)

Section: Testing effects

Testing effects runs at the very end of each turn, right before the next test step is scheduled - even if the same test step repeats.

	Testing effects of starting-out:
		assert that the location is Bridge of Doom with label "the player's location";
		assert that the event description includes "dodging would be suicidal";

Section: Player and NPC actions

There are two rulebooks for making the player take an action: "Choosing a player action" and "Choosing a player reaction." These rulebooks, which have default success, have a default rule at the end that makes the player wait. Both should make use of the "generate (action - a stored action)" phrase.

	Choosing a player action when testing starting-out:
		generate the action of going the best route from the location to the location of the swarm of daggers.

	Choosing a player reaction when testing dagger-strike:
		generate the action of dodging.

Since these rulebooks are NOT test-step based, we must need to use "when testing (move - a test step)" instead of giving a test step as the object of the rule.

To make other people do things, we can use the "compel (action - a stored action)" phrase.

	Initial scheduling of dagger-strike:
		compel the action of the swarm of daggers attacking the player.

By default, all (non-compelled) NPC actions are suppressed during tests. In the transcript, we can see when a character gets a combat round because the message "[suppressed action for X]" appears. NPCs are allowed to react, however. If we do want to allow NPCs to act freely, we can set a property of the test step:
	
	ape-cowering is an npc-enabling test step.
	
We can also enable AI actions manually with the phrase:

	Let everyone act freely;
	
And disable them again with:
	
	Make everone wait;
	
Here's a little example of a complete test step:
	
	Armadillo-runner is a test step.
	
	Initial scheduling of armadillo-runner:
		now the melee of the armadillo is 100;
		
	Choosing a player action when testing armadillo-runner:
		generate the action of going the way-to-get-back.
		
	Testing effects of armadillo-runner:
		assert result "The ravenous armadillo deals \d<^\n>+ damage";

Section: Handling Questions

Kerkerkruip occasionally asks the player questions. If we want the player to answer a menu question instead of taking an action, we can use the "select menu question answer (N - a number)" phrase:

	Choosing a player action when testing entree-selection:
		Let m be 0;
		repeat with entree running through banquet-items:
			increment m;
			if the entree is the overmind:
				break;
		select menu question answer m;

Section: Outcomes

Automated Testing defines a kind of value called "outcome." Outcomes help us make repeated assertions, and assertions that must be grouped together. They must be defined in the Table of Outcomes:
	
	Table of Outcomes (continued)
	outcome	description	likelihood	minimum attempts	maximum attempts
	healer-healing-player	""	0	20	100

An outcome starts out "untested," and then when it is first tested it becomes "possible." If the test is conclusive, it will become either "achieved" or "failed." We have phrases to do this, which perform the necessary assertions for us:
	
	test Bodmall-reaction against whether or not Bodmall is at-react;
	test ape-cowering against "The blood ape cowers before your dreadful presence!";
	
	achieve bat crashing into spike based on whether or not the injury of the player is at least 1;
	achieve nested belief on result "I believe that I believe";
	
	fail healer-healing player based on whether or not the injury of the player is less than 3;
	fail forbidden-teleport on result "Malygris suddenly teleports away";

When an outcome is tested, its likelihood is compared with its minimum and maximum attempts. Exactly how many times it is tested depends on these three numbers:

In the general case, we use the "test ... against" phrase to test an outcome. It will be tested for the minimum number of attempts, and then the number of successes (times the condition was met) will be compared with a target frequency. The target frequency is calculated as (likelihood/minimum attempts). If the number of successes ever comes close enough to the target, the event will be achieved, and if the maximum number of attempts is reached without ever coming in range, it will fail.

The "achieve" and "fail" phrases are for outcomes that are tested repeatedly until they happen once. In the "achieve" case, the outcome will be tested up to the maximum attempts, but in the "fail" case, testing will stop after the minimum attempts. If the given condition (either a regular expression match or a truth state) is met, the outcome will be achieved or failed depending on which phrase we invoked.

We can use the standard "test...against" phrase to get the same behavior as "achieve and fail:" if the likelihood of an event is set to 0, testing it has the same effect as the "fail" phrase. If the likelihood is set to the minimum attempts, the effect is similar, but the result must be true to succeed, instead of false. If the minimum attempts is set to 0, testing the outcome has the same effect as the "achieve" phrase - that is, it will be achieved as soon as the result is true. Here are some examples:
	
	Table of Outcomes (continued)
	outcome	likelihood	minimum attempts
	nested belief	1	0
	healer-healing-player	0	20
	healer-not-healing-player	20	20
	
	achieve nested belief on result "I believe that I believe"
	test nested belief against result "I believe that I believe" [same as above]
	
	fail healer-healing-player based on whether or not the injury of the player is 3;
	test healer-healing-player against whether or not the injury of the player is less than 3; [same as above]
	test healer-not-healing-player against whether or not the injury of the player is at least 3; [same again]

In some cases the action repetition of outcomes can be handled for us. Any test step will repeat if there are outcomes currently set to "outcome-possible." There are some predefined outcomes we can use implicitly. The most common one is used this way:

	Testing effects of sound-finding:
		succeed based on whether or not maze-sound is a cardinal direction.

	Testing effects of banshee-returning:
		succeed on result "banshees suddenly break loose";
	
	Testing effects of imp-dreaming:
		fail based on whether or not the imp is in the location within 20 attempts;

	Testing effects of no-extra-blessed-grenade:
		fail on result "Blessed Grenade" within 100 attempts.

The "within X attempts" is optional for all four phrase styles, and manually sets the minimum or maximum attempts based on whether we are looking for success or failure.

We must keep in mind that an outcome does not normally become possible until it is tested. That works fine if we test it in the "testing effects" rulebook, because that is guaranteed to run for every test step. But if our outcome depends on something that doesn't necessarily happen every turn, we may need to manually make it possible:
	
Initial scheduling for ape-cower-test:
	make ape-cowering possible.
	
We can also repeat outcome tests outside of the normal test step loop. We use a special phrase as a while condition:

	While we haven't reset combat hit:

Section: Outcome dependencies

Some outcomes may not be testable until certain other conditions are met. We can ensure that those conditions are met without getting stuck in an infinite loop if they don't. The way to do this is with dependencies, or as they are called with outcomes, "antecedents."

	Table of Outcomes (continued)
	outcome	antecedent
	drakul statement	--
	nested belief	drakul statement
	
Antecedents are checked automatically before recording success or failure of an outcome. If we do this:
	
	achieve drakul statement on result "Drakul says, '";
	achieve nested belief on result "I believe that I believe";
	
Nested Belief will not be tested unless Drakul Statement has just happened. Note that Drakul Statement will have been achieved after the first pass, but it will continue to be checked as long as it has unresolved "dependents" - that is, other outcomes that have it for an antecedent. However, once its maximum attempts have been reached, all of its dependents will "time out" - whether or not they have been resolved.

Section: Generation tests

Outcome states and dependencies can be maintained even after a restart. This makes a convenient way to test dungeon generation. To test the state of the game after dungeon generation, use the "generation test" rulebook:
	
	Table of Outcomes (continued)
	outcome	likelihood	minimum attempts	maximum attempts	antecedent
	got-addicts-amulet	2	64	256	--
	cursed-addicts-amulet	2	2	--	got-addicts-amulet	

	Generation test when testing starting-kits-test:
		test got-addicts-amulet against whether or not the player wears the addict's amulet;
	
At the time of this writing (2015-03-23), we will get stuck in an infinite loop if we add any test steps after testing an outcome in a generation test. We must limit our test sets to either test dungeon generation or turns, but not both.

Section: Combat tests

Some of the most interesting and complex mechanics in Kerkerkruip involve combat, and many of them take place during the hitting action. We have some special phrases to help us tease these mechanics out:
	
	now the health of the player is 1000;
	now the melee of the mindslug is 100;
	clear event description;
	try the mindslug hitting the player;
	check damage of the player with 1000 health after "The mindslug deals";

The "check damage" phrase extracts all the text it finds in the event description between the prefix we supply ("The mindslug deals") and the final text " damage". Then it reads all the damage comments in this text and checks that they add up to the total, and compares the total to the health of the person specified in the phrase. We supply the value of the person's health before the damage occurred, and the phrase asserts that everything is as expected. It also resets health to the number we specified so we can perform more of the same tests. It also saves the text it extracted from the event description in a variable called "the damage description," which we can test ourselves:
	
	assert that the damage description includes "\+ 1 \(you are running\) ";
	assert that the damage description does not include "Giantbane's special";
	
We can also automate the hitting itself:
	
	have Fafhrd do no reaction to a 100 melee hit with result "You deal";

	have fafhrd do a parry reaction to a 0 melee hit with result "Having been in contact with the scythe of oxidation, the claymore rusts";
	
	have the player do a parry reaction to a 0 melee hit by Fafhrd with result "The claymore shatters the gilded rapier!";

	have mouser do a dodge reaction to a 100 melee hit by the player with result "you drop the gilded rapier" in 1 out of 6 attempts;

	have the player do a parry reaction to a 100 melee hit by mouser with result "you drop the gilded rapier" in 0 out of 20 attempts;

	have the player do no reaction to a 100 melee hit by the armadillo with result "\+ [conc-level * 25]% \(robe of the dead mage\)", checking damage;
	
	have the player do no reaction to a 100 melee hit by the armadillo with result "robe of the dead mage" in 0 out of 1 attempts, checking damage;
	
Each of these phrases performs a hit for us, setting a number of important conditions. It sets the health of the person being hit to 1000, and sets their reaction (no reaction doesn't set anything, block reaction sets them to at-block, and similarly for the parry reaction and dodge reaction). It sets the melee of the attacker to the number we specify and it sets the defence of the defender to 50, so we can be reasonably sure whether the attack will hit or not. For the result we give a text to match with the result of the hit, which will serve as our success condition.

If we don't specify a number of attempts, it does just one. If we do, it sets that as the minimum attempts for an outcome called "combat hit" and repeats the attempt until it is achieved or failed.

Finally, we can specify whether we're checking damage. If we're not checking damage, the result text is matched against the entire event description. But if we do, not only does the phrase invoke the "check damage" test, it also compares the result text with the damage description instead of the event description.

These phrases all make sure that the final hit is successful (as long the combat hit was achieved), so we can test additional circumstances afterwards. Here's an example of how this can be useful:
	
	have mouser do a dodge reaction to a 100 melee hit by the player with result "you drop the gilded rapier" in 1 out of 6 attempts;
	assert "the gilded rapier should be on the floor" based on whether or not the gilded rapier is in the location;

The "X melee hit" phrase does quite a bit of cleanup after each attack, including restoring any dropped, rusted, or shattered weapons. [TODO: hooks or rulebook for this?] Using the combination of the cleanup stage and the "after success" requirement, we can test not only the frequency with which the greasy gauntlets cause the player to drop a weapon, but also what happens afterwards.

Section: Other properties of test steps

TODO. (There are lots more properties of test steps - look through the code to see what they do. Location-target and hiding-check are useful for getting around the dungeon, for example.)

Section: Controlling text capture

We've already gone over the basics of how text is captured, but sometimes we need a little bit more. Because sometimes the system needs to stop capturing and display something to the screen, the full output of the current turn is saved in a "event description." This is automatically cleared at the beginning of a turn and updated when it is likely to be needed. Recall that we may use these phrases to clear and update the captured text:
		
clear the event description because "starting an iteration of the foobar test"

update the event description because "checking for frobnitz usage"

We can also control output directly, both to the screen and to the transcript. If we want to output information to the screen, use the phrase:

log (message - a text)

And if we want to output something to the transcript only, use the phrase:

transcribe (message - a text)
